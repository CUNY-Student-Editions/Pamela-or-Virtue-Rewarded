<h1 class="ct"><span class="sc">Preface by the Editor.</span>
<p class="ct"><span class="it">IF to</span> Divert <span class="it">and</span> Entertain,<span class="it"> and at the same time to</span> Instruct, <span class="it">and</span> Improve <span class="it">the Minds of the</span> <span class="sc">Youth</span> of both Sexes:</p>
<br/>
<p><span class="it">IF to inculcate</span> Religion <span class="it">and</span> Morality <span class="it">in so easy and agreeable a manner, as shall render them equally</span> delightful <span class="it">and</span> profitable <span class="it">to the</span> younger Class <span class="it">of Readers, as well as worthy of the Attention of Persons of</span> maturer <span class="it">Years and Understandings:</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span class="it">IF to set forth in the most exemplary Lights, the</span> Parental, <span class="it">the</span> Filial, <span class="it">and the</span> Social <span class="it">Duties, and that from</span> low <span class="it">to</span> high <span class="it">Life:</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span class="it">IF to paint</span> <span class="sc">Vice</span> <span class="it">in its proper Colours, to make it</span> deservedly; Odious<span class="it"> and to set <span class="sc">Virtue</span> <span class="it">in its own amiable Light, to make it</span> truly Lovely:</p>
<br/>
<p><span class="it">IF to draw Characters</span> justly, <span class="it">and to support them</span> equally:</p>
<br/>
<p><span class="it">IF to raise a Distress from</span> natural <span class="it">Causes, and to excite Compassion from</span> proper <span class="it">Motives:</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span class="it">IF to teach the Man of</span> Fortune <span class="it">how to</span> use <span class="it">it; the Man of</span> Passion <span class="it">how to</span> subdue <span class="it">it; and the Man of</span> Intrigue, <span class="it">how, gracefully, and with Honour to himself, to</span> reclaim:</p>
<br/>
<p><span class="it">IF to give</span> practical <span class="it">Examples, worthy to be followed in the most</span> critical <span class="it">and</span> affecting <span class="it">Cases, by the modest</span> Virgin, <span class="it">the chaste</span> Bride, <span class="it">and the obliging</span> Wife:</p>
<br/>
<p><span class="it">IF to effect all these good Ends, in so probable, so natural, so</span> lively <span class="it">a manner, as shall engage the Passions of every sensible Reader* and strongly interest them in the edifying Story:</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span class="it">AND all without raising a</span> single Idea <span class="it">throughout the Whole, that shall shock the exactest Purity, even in those tender Instances where the exactest Purity would be most apprehensive:</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span class="it">IF these, (embellished with a great Variety of entertaining Incidents) be laudable or worthy Recommendations of any Work, the Editor of the following Letters, which have their Foundation in</span> Truth <span class="it">and</span> Nature, <span class="it">ventures to assert, that all these desirable Ends are obtained in these Sheets: And as he is therefore confident of the favourable Reception which he boldly bespeaks for this little Work; he thinks any further</span> Preface <span class="it">or</span> Apology <span class="it">for it, unnecessary: And the rather for two Reasons, 1st. Because he can Appeal from</span> his own <span class="it">Passions, (which have been uncommonly moved in perusing these engaging Scenes) to the Passions of</span> Every one <span class="it">who shall read them with the least Attention: And, in the next place, because an</span> Editor <span class="it">may reasonably be supposed to judge with an Impartiality which is rarely to be met with in an</span> Author <span class="it'>towards his own Works.</span></p>
