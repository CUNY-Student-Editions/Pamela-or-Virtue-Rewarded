	<p class="first preface"><span class="first-word">If</span> to <strong>Divert</strong> and <strong>Entertain</strong>, and at the same time to <strong>Instruct</strong>, and <strong>Improve</strong> the Minds of the <em>YOUTH</em> of both Sexes:</p>
	<p class="preface"><span class="first-word">If</span> to inculcate <strong>Religion</strong> and <strong>Morality</strong> in so easy and agreeable a manner, as shall render them equally <strong>delightful</strong> and <strong>profitable</strong> to the  <strong>younger Class</strong> of Readers, as well as worthy of the Attention of Persons of <strong>maturer</strong> Years and Understandings:</p>
	<p class="preface"><span class-_first-word_="">If</span> to set forth in the most exemplary Lights, the <strong>Parental</strong>, the <strong>Filial</strong>, and the <strong>Social</strong> Duties, and that from <strong>low</strong>  to <strong>high</strong> Life:</p>
	<p class="preface"><span class="first-word">If</span> to paint <em>Vice</em> in its proper Colours, to make it <strong>deservedly Odious</strong>; and to set <em>Virtue</em> in its own amiable Light, to make it <strong>truly Lovely</strong>:</p>
	<p class="preface"><span class="first-word">If</span> to draw Characters <strong>justly</strong>, and to support them <strong>equally</strong>:</p>
	<p class="preface"><span class="first-word">If</span> to raise a Distress from <strong>natural</strong> Causes, and to excite Compassion from <strong>proper</strong> Motives:</p>
	<p class="preface"><span class="first-word">If</span> to teach the Man of <strong>Fortune</strong> how to <strong>use</strong> it; the Man of <strong>Passion</strong> how to <strong>subdue</strong> it; and the Man of <strong>Intrigue</strong>, how, gracefully, and with Honour to himself, to <strong>reclaim</strong>:</p>
	<p class="preface"><span class="first-word">If</span> to give <strong>practical</strong> Examples, worthy to be followed in the most <strong>critical</strong> and <strong>affecting</strong> Cases, by the modest <strong>Virgin</strong>, the chaste <strong>Bride</strong>, and the obliging <strong>Wife</strong>:</p>
	<p class="preface"><span class="first-word">If</span> to effect all these good Ends, in so probable, so natural, so <strong>lively</strong> a manner, as shall engage the Passions of every sensible Reader and strongly interest them in the edifying Story:</p>
	<p class="preface"><span class="first-word">And</span> all without raising a <strong>single Idea</strong> throughout the Whole, that shall shock the exactest Purity, even in those tender Instances where the exactest Purity would be most apprehensive:</p>
	<p class="preface"><span class="first-word">If</span> these, (embellished with a great Variety of entertaining Incidents) be laudable or worthy Recommendations of any Work, the Editor of the following Letters, which have their Foundation in <strong>Truth</strong> and <strong>Nature</strong>, ventures to assert, that all these desirable Ends are obtained in these Sheets: And as he is therefore confident of the favourable Reception which he boldly bespeaks for this little Work; he thinks any <strong>further Preface</strong> or <strong>Apology </strong> for it, unnecessary: And the rather for two Reasons, 1st. Because he can Appeal from <strong>his own</strong> Passions, (which have been uncommonly <strong>moved</strong> in perusing these engaging Scenes) to the Passions of <strong>Every one</strong> who shall read them with the least Attention: And, in the next place, because an <strong>Editor</strong> may reasonably be supposed to judge with an Impartiality which is rarely to be met with in an <strong>Author</strong> towards his own Works.</p>

	<h2 class="title">To the Editor of the Piece Intitled, <em>Pamela</em>; or, <em class="small-caps">Virtue</em> <em>Rewarded</em>.</h2>
	<div class="letter">
		<p class="salutation">Dear <strong>Sir</strong>,</p>
		<p class="first"><span class="first-word">I have</span> had inexpressible Pleasure in the Perusal of your <em class="small-caps">Pamela</em>. It intirely answers the Character you give of it in your Preface; nor have you said one Word too much in Commendation of a Piece that has Advantages and Excellencies peculiar to itself. For, besides the beautiful Simplicity of the Style, and a happy Propriety and Clearness of Expression (the Letters being written under the immediate Impression of every Circumstance which occasioned them, and that to those who had a Right to know the fair Writer’s most secret Thoughts) the several Passions of the Mind must, of course, be more affectingly described, and Nature may be traced in her undisguised Inclinations with much more Propriety and Exactness, than can possibly be found in a Detail of Actions long past, which are never recollected with the same Affections, Hopes, and Dreads, with which they were felt when they occurred.</p>
		<p>This little Book will infallibly be looked upon as the hitherto much-wanted Standard or Pattern for this Kind of Writing. For it abounds with lively Images and Pictures; with Incidents natural, surprising, and perfectly adapted to the Story; with Circumstances interesting to Persons in common Life, as well as to those in exalted Stations. The greatest Regard is every where paid in it to Decency, and to every Duty of Life: There is a constant Fitness of the Style to the Persons and Characters described; Pleasure and Instruction here always go hand in hand: Vice and Virtue are set in constant Opposition, and Religion every-where inculcated in its native Beauty and chearful Amiableness; not dressed up in stiff, melancholy, or gloomy Forms, on one hand, nor yet, on the other, debased below its due Dignity and noble Requisites, in Compliment to a too fashionable but depraved Taste. And this I will boldly say, that if its numerous Beauties are added to its excellent Tendency, it will be found worthy a Place, not only in all Families (especially such as have in them young Persons of either Sex) but in the Collections of the most curious and polite Readers. For, as it borrows none of its Excellencies from the romantic Flights of unnatural Fancy, its being founded in Truth and Nature, and built upon Experience, will be a lasting Recommendation to the Discerning and Judicious; while the agreeable Variety of Occurrences and Characters, in which it abounds, will not fail to engage the Attention of the gay and more sprightly Readers.</p>
		<p>The moral Reflections and Uses to be drawn from the several Parts of this admirable History, are so happily deduced from a Croud of different Events and Characters, in the Conclusion of the Work, that I shall say the less on that Head. But I think, the Hints you have given me, should also prefatorily be given to the Publick; <strong>viz</strong>. That it will appear from several Things mentioned in the Letters, that the Story must have happened within these Thirty Years past: That you have been obliged to vary some of the Names of Persons, Places, <strong>&amp;c</strong>. and to disguise a few of the Circumstances, in order to avoid giving Offence to some Persons, who would not chuse to be pointed out too plainly in it; tho’ they would be glad it may do the Good so laudably intended by the Publication. And as you have in Confidence submitted to my Opinion some of those Variations, I am much pleased that you have so managed the Matter, as to make no Alteration in the Facts; and, at the same time, have avoided the digressive Prolixity too frequently used on such Occasions.</p>
		<br class="small-break"/>
		<p>Little Book, charming <em class="small-caps">Pamela</em>! face the World, and never doubt of finding Friends and Admirers, not only in thine own Country, but far from Home; where thou mayst give an Example of Purity to the Writers of a neighbouring Nation; which now shall have an Opportunity to receive <strong>English</strong> Bullion in Exchange for its own Dross, which has so long passed current among us in Pieces abounding with all the Levities of its volatile Inhabitants. The reigning Depravity of the Times has yet left Virtue many Votaries. Of their Protection you need not despair. May every head-strong Libertine whose Hands you reach, be reclaimed; and every tempted Virgin who reads you, imitate the Virtue, and meet the Reward of the high-meriting, tho’ low-descended, <em class="small-caps">Pamela</em> I am, Sir,</p>
		<p class="signature">Your most Obedient,<br/>
			and Faithful Servant,<br/>

	<h2>To my worthy Friend, the Editor of <em class="small-caps">Pamela</em></h2>
	<div class="letter">
		<p class="salutation"><strong>Sir</strong>,</p>
		<p class="first"><span class="first-word">I return</span> the Manuscript of <strong>Pamela</strong> by the Bearer, which I have read with a great deal of Pleasure. It is written with that Spirit of Truth and agreeable Simplicity, which, tho’ much wanted, is seldom found in those Pieces which are calculated for the Entertainment and Instruction of the Publick. It carries Conviction in every Part of it; and the Incidents are so natural and interesting, that I have gone hand-in-hand, and sympathiz’d with the pretty Heroine in all her Sufferings, and been extremely anxious for her Safety, under the Apprehensions of the bad Consequences which I expected, every Page, would ensue from the laudable Resistance she made. I have interested myself in all her Schemes of Escape; been alternately pleas’d and angry with her in her Restraint; <strong>pleas’d</strong> with the little Machinations and Contrivances she set on foot for her Release, and <strong>angry</strong> for suffering her Fears to defeat them; always lamenting, with a most sensible Concern, the Miscarriages of her Hopes and Projects. In short, the whole is so affecting, that there is no reading it without uncommon Concern and Emotion. Thus far only as to the <strong>Entertainment</strong> it gives.</p>
		<p>As to <strong>Instruction</strong> and <strong>Morality</strong>, the Piece is full of both. It shews Virtue in the strongest Light, and renders the Practice of it amiable and lovely. The beautiful Sufferer keeps it ever in her View, without the least Ostentation, or Pride; she has it so strongly implanted in her, that thro’ the whole Course of her Sufferings, she does not so much as hesitate once, whether she shall sacrifice it to Liberty and Ambition, or not; but, as if there were no other way to free and save herself, carries on a determin’d Purpose to persevere in her Innocence, and wade with it throughout all Difficulties and Temptations, or perish under them. It is an astonishing Matter, and well worth our most serious Consideration, that a young beautiful Girl, in the low Scene of Life and Circumstance in which Fortune placed her, without the Advantage of a Friend capable to relieve and protect her, or any other Education than what occurr’d to her from her own Observation and little Reading, in the Course of her Attendance on her excellent Mistress and Benefactress, could, after having a Taste of Ease and Plenty in a higher Sphere of Life than what she was born and first brought up in, resolve to return to her primitive Poverty, rather than give up her Innocence. I say, it is surprizing, that a young Person, so circumstanced, could, in Contempt of proffer’d Grandeur on the one side, and in Defiance of Penury on the other, so happily and prudently conduct herself thro’ such a Series of Perplexities and Troubles, and withstand the alluring Baits, and almost irresistible Offers of a fine Gentleman, so universally admired and esteemed, for the Agreeableness of his Person and good Qualities, among all his Acquaintance; defeat all his Measures with so much Address, and oblige him, at last, to give over his vain Pursuit, and sacrifice his Pride and Ambition to Virtue, and become the Protector of that Innocence which he so long and so indefatigably labour’d to supplant: And all this without ever having entertain’d the least previous Design or Thought for that Purpose: No Art used to inflame him, no Coquetry practised to tempt or intice him, and no Prudery or Affectation to tamper with his Passions; but, on the contrary, artless and unpractised in the Wiles of the World, all her Endeavours, and even all her Wishes, tended only to render herself as un-amiable as she could in his Eyes: Tho’ at the same time she is so far from having any Aversion to his Person, that she seems rather prepossess’d in his Favour, and admires his Excellencies, whilst she condemns his Passion for her. A glorious Instance of Self-denial! Thus her very Repulses became Attractions: The more she resisted, the more she charm’d; and the very Means she used to guard her Virtue, the more indanger’d it, by inflaming his Passions: Till, at last, by Perseverance, and a brave and resolute Defence, the Besieged not only obtain’d a glorious Victory over the Besieger, but took him Prisoner too.</p>
		<p>I am charmed with the beautiful Reflections she makes in the Course of her Distresses; her Soliloquies and little Reasonings with herself, are exceeding pretty and entertaining: She pours out all her Soul in them before her Parents without Disguise; so that one may judge of, nay, almost see, the inmost Recesses of her Mind. A pure clear Fountain of Truth and Innocence, a Magazine of Virtue and unblemish’d Thoughts!</p>
		<p>I can’t conceive why you should hesitate a Moment as to the Publication of this very natural and uncommon Piece. I could wish to see it out in its own native Simplicity, which will affect and please the Reader beyond all the Strokes of Oratory in the World; for those will but spoil it: and, should you permit such a murdering Hand to be laid upon it, to gloss and tinge it over with superfluous and needless Decorations, which, like too much Drapery in Sculpture and Statuary, will but incumber it; it may disguise the Facts, marr the Reflections, and unnaturalize the Incidents, so as to be lost in a Multiplicity of fine idle Words and Phrases, and reduce our Sterling Substance into an empty Shadow, or rather <strong>frenchify</strong> our <strong>English</strong> Solidity into Froth and Whip-syllabub. No; let us have <strong>Pamela</strong> as <strong>Pamela</strong> wrote it; in her own Words, without Amputation, or Addition. Produce her to us in her neat Country Apparel, such as she appear’d in, on her intended Departure to her Parents; for such best becomes her Innocence and beautiful Simplicity. Such a Dress will best edify and entertain. The flowing Robes of Oratory may indeed amuse and amaze, but will never strike the Mind with solid Attention.</p>
		<p>In short, Sir, a Piece of this Kind is much wanted in the World, which is but too much, as well as too early debauched by pernicious <strong>Novels</strong>. I know nothing Entertaining of that Kind that one might venture to recommend to the Perusal (much less the Imitation) of the Youth of either Sex: All that I have hitherto read, tends only to corrupt their Principles, mislead their Judgments, and initiate them into Gallantry and loose Pleasures.</p>
		<p>Publish then, this good, this edifying and instructive little Piece for their Sakes. The Honour of <strong>Pamela’s</strong> Sex demands <strong>Pamela</strong> at your Hands, to shew the World an Heroine, almost beyond Example, in an unusual Scene of Life, whom no Temptations, or Sufferings, could subdue. It is a fine, and glorious Original, for the Fair to copy out and imitate. Our own Sex, too, require it of you, to free us, in some measure, from the Imputation of being incapable of the Impressions of Virtue and Honour; and to shew the Ladies, that we are not inflexible while they are so.</p>
		<p>In short, the Cause of Virtue, calls for the Publication of such a Piece as this. Oblige then, Sir, the concurrent Voices of both Sexes, and give us <strong>Pamela</strong> for the Benefit of Mankind: And as I believe its Excellencies cannot be long unknown to the World, and that there will not be a Family without it; so I make no Doubt but every Family that has it, will be much improv’d and better’d by it. ’Twill form the tender Minds of <strong>Youth</strong> for the Reception and Practice of Virtue and Honour; confirm and establish those of <strong>maturer Years</strong> on good and steady Principles; reclaim the Vicious, and mend the Age in general; insomuch that as I doubt not <strong>Pamela</strong> will become the bright Example and Imitation of all the fashionable young Ladies of <strong>Great Britain</strong>; so the truly generous Benefactor and Rewarder of her exemplary Virtue, will be no less admired and imitated among the <strong>Beau Monde</strong> of our own Sex. I am,</p>
		<p class="signature">Your affectionate Friend, &amp;c.</p>
