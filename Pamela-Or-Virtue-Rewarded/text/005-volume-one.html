				<h1>Letter I</h1>
				<p class="salutation">Dear Father and Mother,</em>
				<p class="first">I Have great Trouble, and some Comfort, to acquaint you with. The Trouble is, that my good Lady died of the Illness I mention’d to you, and left us all much griev’d for her Loss; for she was a dear good Lady, and kind to all us her Servants. Much I fear’d, that as I was taken by her Goodness to wait upon her Person, I should be quite destitute again, and forc’d to return to you and my poor Mother, who have so much to do to maintain yourselves; and, as my Lady’s Goodness had put me to write and cast Accompts, and made me a little expert at my Needle, and other Qualifications above my Degree, it would have been no easy Matter to find a Place that your poor <em class="italics">Pamela</em> was fit for: But God, whose Graciousness to us we have so often experienc’d at a Pinch, put it into my good Lady’s Heart, on her Death-bed, just an Hour before she expir’d, to recommend to my young Master all her Servants, one by one; and when it came to my Turn to be recommended, for I was sobbing and crying at her Pillow, she could only say, My dear Son!—and so broke off a little, and then recovering—Remember my poor <em class="italics">Pamela!</em>—And these were some of her last Words! O how my Eyes run!—Don’t wonder to see the Paper so blotted!</p>
				<p>Well, but God’s Will must be done!—and so comes the Comfort, that I shall not be oblig’d to return back to be a Clog upon my dear Parents! For my Master said, I will take care of you all, my Lasses; and for you, <em class="italics">Pamela</em>, (and took me by the Hand; yes, he took me by the Hand before them all) for my dear Mother’s sake, I will be a Friend to you, and you shall take care of my Linen. God bless him! and pray with me, my dear Father and Mother, for God to bless him: For he has given Mourning and a Year’s Wages to all my Lady’s Servants; and I having no Wages as yet, but what my Lady said she would do for me as I deserv’d, order’d the House-keeper to give me Mourning with the rest, and gave me with his own Hand Four golden Guineas, besides lesser Money, which were in my old Lady’s Pocket when she dy’d; and said, If I was a good Girl, and faithful and diligent, he would be a Friend to me, for his Mother’s sake. And so I send you these four Guineas for your Comfort; for God will not let me want: And so you may pay some old Debt with Part; and keep the other Part to comfort you both. If I get more, I am sure it is my Duty, and it shall be my Care to love and cherish you both; for you have lov’d me and cherish’d me, when I could do nothing for myself: And so you have for us all, or what must have become of us! I send it by <em class="italics">John</em> our Footman, who goes your way; but he does not know what he carries; because I seal it up in one of the little Pill-boxes which my Lady had, wrapt close in Paper, that it mayn’t chink; and be sure don’t open it before him.</p>
				<p>I know, dear Father and Mother, I must give you both Grief and Pleasure; and so I will only say, Pray for your <em class="italics">Pamela;</em> who will ever be,</p>
				<p class="signature">Your most dutiful Daughter.</p>
				<section class="postscript">
						<p>I have been scared out of my Senses; for just now, as I was folding this Letter, in my late Lady’s Dressing-room, in comes my young Master! Good Sirs! how was I frightned! I went to hide the Letter in my Bosom, and he seeing me frighted, said, smiling, Who have you been writing to, <em class="italics">Pamela?</em>—I said, in my Fright, Pray your Honour forgive me!—Only to my Father and Mother. He said, Well then, Let me see how you are come on in your Writing! O how I was sham’d!—He, in my Fright, took it, without saying more, and read it quite thro’, and then gave it me again;—and I said, Pray your Honour forgive me;—yet I know not for what. For he was always dutiful to his Parents; and why should he be angry, that I was so to mine! And indeed he was not angry; for he took me by the Hand, and said, You are a good Girl, <em class="italics">Pamela</em>, to be kind to your aged Father and Mother. I am not angry with you. Be faithful, and diligent; and do as you should do, and I like you the better for this. And then he said, Why, <em class="italics">Pamela</em>, you write a very pretty Hand, and spell tolerably too. I see my good Mother’s Care in your Learning has not been thrown away upon you. My Mother used to say, you lov’d reading; you may look into any of her Books to improve yourself, so you take care of them. To be sure I did nothing but curchee and cry, and was all in Confusion, at his Goodness. Indeed he is the best of Gentlemen, I think! But I am making another long Letter. So will only say more, I shall ever be,</p>

				<h1 class="title">Letter II</h1>
				<h2 class="subtitle">In Answer to the preceding</h2>
				<p class="salutation">Dear <em>Pamela</em>,</p>
				<p class="first"><span class="first-word">Your</span> Letter was indeed a great Trouble and some Comfort to me, and your poor Mother. We are troubled, to be sure, for your good Lady’s Death, who took such care of you, and gave you Learning, and for Three Years past has always been giving you Cloaths and Linen, and every thing that a Gentlewoman need not be asham’d to appear in. But our chief Trouble is, and indeed a very great one, for fear you should be brought to any thing dishonest or wicked, by being set so above yourself. Every body talks how you have come on, and what a genteel Girl you are, and some say, you are very pretty; and indeed, Six Months since, when I saw you last, I should have thought so too, if you was not our Child. But what avails all this, if you are to be ruin’d and undone!—Indeed, my dear Child, we begin to be in great Fear for you; for what signifies all the Riches in the World with a bad Conscience, and to be dishonest? We are, ’tis true, very poor, and find it hard enough to live; tho’ once, as you know, it was better with us. But we would sooner live upon the Water and Clay of the Ditches I am forc’d to dig, than to live better at the Price of our dear Child’s Ruin.</p>
				<p>I hope the good ’Squire has no Design; but when he has given you so much Money, and speaks so kindly to you, and praises your coming on; and Oh! that fatal Word, that he would be kind to you, if you would do as <em class="italics">you should do</em>, almost kills us with Fears.</p>
				<p>I have spoken to good old Widow <em class="italics">Mumford</em> about it, who, you know, has formerly lived in good Families, and she puts us in some Comfort; for she says, it is not unusual, when a Lady dies, to give what she has about her to her Waiting-maid, and to such as sit up with her in her Illness. But then, why should he smile so kindly upon you? Why should he take such a poor Girl as you by the Hand, as your Letter says he has done twice? Why should he stoop to read your Letter to us; and commend your Writing and Spelling? And, why should he give you Leave to read his Mother’s Books!—Indeed, indeed, my dearest Child, our Hearts ake for you; and then you seem so full of Joy at his Goodness, so taken with his kind Expressions, which truly are very great Favours, if he means well, that we fear—Yes, my dear Child, we fear—you should be <em class="italics">too</em> grateful,—and reward him with that Jewel, your Virtue, which no Riches, nor Favour, nor any thing in this Life, can make up to you.</p>
				<p>I, too, have written a long Letter; but will say one Thing more; and that is, That in the Midst of our Poverty and Misfortunes, we have trusted in God’s Goodness, and been honest, and doubt not to be happy hereafter, if we continue to be good, tho’ our Lot is hard here; but the Loss of our dear Child’s Virtue, would be a Grief that we could not bear, and would bring our grey Hairs to the Grave at once.</p>
				<p>If you love <em class="italics">us</em> then, if you value <em class="italics">God’s</em> Blessing, and <em class="italics">your own</em> future Happiness, we both charge you to stand upon your Guard; and, if you find the least Attempt made upon your Virtue, be sure you leave every thing behind you, and come away to us; for we had rather see you all cover’d with Rags, and even follow you to the Church-yard, than have it said, a Child of ours preferr’d worldly Conveniencies to her Virtue.</p>
				<p>We accept kindly of your dutiful Present; but ‘till we are out of our Pain, cannot make use of it, for fear we should partake of the Price of our poor Daughter’s Shame: So have laid it up in a Rag among the Thatch, over the Window, for a while, lest we should be robb’d. With our Blessings and our hearty Prayers for you, we remain,</p>
				<p class="signature">Your careful, but loving Father and Mother,<br/>
				 <em>John</em> and <em>Elizabeth</em> <em>Andrewes</em>.</p>

				<h1 class="title">Letter III</h1>
			<p class="salutation">Dear Father</p>
			<p class="first">I Must needs say, that your Letter has fill’d me with much Trouble. For it has made my Heart, which was overflowing with Gratitude for my young Master’s Goodness, suspicious and fearful; and yet, I hope I never shall find him to act unworthy of his Character; for what could he get by ruining such a poor young Creature as me? But that which gives me most Trouble is, that you seem to mistrust the Honesty of your Child. No, my dear Father and Mother, be assur’d, that, by God’s Grace, I never will do any thing that shall bring your grey Hairs with Sorrow to the Grave. I will die a thousand Deaths, rather than be dishonest any way. Of that be assur’d, and set your Hearts at rest; for altho’ I have liv’d above myself for some Time past, yet I can be content with Rags and Poverty, and Bread and Water, and will embrace them rather than forfeit my good Name, let who will be the Tempter. And of this rest satisfy’d, and think better of</p>
			<p class="signature">Your dutiful Daughter till Death.</p>
			<p class="postscript">My Master continues to be very affable to me. As yet I see no Cause to fear any thing. Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> the House-keeper too is very civil to me, and I have the Love of every body. Sure they can’t <em class="italics">all</em> have Designs against me because they are civil. I hope I shall always behave so as to be respected by every one; and hope nobody would do me more hurt, than I am sure I would do them. Our <em class="italics">John</em> so often goes your way, that I will always get him to call that you may hear from me, either by Writing, for it brings my Hand in, or by Word of Mouth.</p>

			<h1 class="title">Letter IV</h1>
			<p class="salutation">Dear Mother,</p>
			<p class="noindent">FOR the last Letter was to my Father, in Answer to his Letter; and so I will now write to you; tho’ I have nothing to say but what will make me look more like a vain Hussy, than any thing else: Yet I hope I shan’t be so proud as to forget myself. Yet there is a secret Pleasure one has to hear one’s self prais’d. You must know then, that my Lady <em class="italics">Davers</em>, who, you know, is my Master’s Sister, has been a whole Month at our House, and has taken great Notice of me, and given me good Advice to keep myself to myself; she told me I was a very pretty Wench, and that every body gave me a very good Character, and lov’d me; and bid me take care to keep the Fellows at a Distance; and said, <em class="italics">that</em> I might do, and be more valu’d for it, even by themselves. But what pleas’d me much, was, that at Table, as Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> was telling me, my Master and her Ladyship were talking of me, and she told him, she thought me the prettiest Wench she ever saw in her Life; and that I was too pretty to live in a Batchelor’s House; and that no Lady he might marry, would care to continue me with her. He said, I was vastly improv’d, and had a good Share of Prudence, and Sense above my Years; and it would be Pity, that what was my Merit, should be my Misfortune.—No, says my good Lady, <em class="italics">Pamela</em> shall come and live with me, I think. He said, With all his Heart, he should be glad to have me so well provided for. Well, said she, I’ll consult my Lord about it. She ask’d how old I was; and Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> said, I was Fifteen last <em class="italics">February</em>. O! says she, if the Wench (for so she calls all us Maiden Servants) takes care of herself, she’ll improve yet more and more, as well in her Person as Mind.</p>
			<p>Now, my dear Father and Mother, tho’ this may look too vain to be repeated by me, yet are you not rejoic’d as well as I, to see my Master so willing to part with me?—This shews that he has nothing bad in his Heart. But <em class="italics">John</em> is just going away, and so I have only to say, that I am, and will always be,</p>
			<p class="right"><em class="italics">Your honest, as well as dutiful Daughter</em>.</p>
			<p>Pray make use of the Money; you may now do it safely.</p>
			<h3 class="h2"><small class="calibre2">LETTER V</small>.</h3>
			<p class="indent1"><em class="italics">My dear Father and Mother</em>,</p>
			<p class="noindent"><em class="italics">JOHN</em> being going your way, I am willing to write, because he is so willing to carry any thing for me. He says it does him good at his Heart to see you both, and to hear you talk. He says you are both so good, and so honest, that he always learns something from you to the Purpose. It is a thousand Pities, he says, that such honest Hearts should not have better Luck in the World. But this is more Pride to me, that I am come of such honest Parents, than if I had been born a Lady.</p>
			<p>I hear nothing yet of going to Lady <em class="italics">Davers</em>. And I am very easy at present here. For Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> uses me as if I were her own Daughter, and is a very good Woman, and makes my Master’s Interest her own. She is always giving me good Counsel, and I love her, next to you two, I think, best of any body. She keeps so good Rule and Order, she is mightily respected by us all; and takes Delight to hear me read to her; and all she loves to hear read, is good Books, which we read whenever we are alone; so that I think I am at home with you. She heard one of our Men, <em class="italics">Harry</em>, who is no better than he should be, speak freely to me; I think he call’d me his pretty <em class="italics">Pamela</em>, and took hold of me, as if he would have kiss’d me; for which you may be sure I was very angry; and she took him to Task, and was as angry at him as could be, and told me she was very well pleas’d to see my Prudence and Modesty, and that I kept all the Fellows at a Distance. And indeed I am sure I am not proud, and carry it civil to every body; but yet, methinks I can’t bear to be look’d upon by these Men-servants; for they seem as if they would look one thro’; and, as I almost always breakfast, dine, and sup with Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em>, so good she is to me, so I am very easy that I have so little to say to them. Not but they are very civil to me in the main, for Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis’s</em> sake, who they see loves me; and they stand in Awe of her, knowing her to be a Gentlewoman born, tho’ she has had Misfortunes. I am going on again with a long Letter; for I love Writing, and shall tire you. But when I began, I only intended to say, that I am quite fearless of any Danger now: And indeed can but wonder at myself, (tho’ your Caution to me was your watchful Love) that I should be so foolish as to be so uneasy as I have been: For I am sure my Master would not demean himself so, as to think upon such a poor Girl as I, for my Harm. For such a Thing would ruin his Credit as well as mine, you know: For, to be sure, he may expect one of the best Ladies in the Land. So no more at present; but that I am</p>
			<p class="right"><em class="italics">Your ever dutiful Daughter</em>.</p>
			<h3 class="h2"><small class="calibre2">LETTER VI</small>.</h3>
			<p class="indent1"><em class="italics">Dear Father and Mother</em>,</p>
			<p class="noindent">MY Master has been very kind since my last; for he has given me a Suit of my old Lady’s Cloaths, and half a Dozen of her Shifts, and Six fine Handkerchiefs, and Three of her Cambrick Aprons, and Four Holland ones: The Cloaths are fine Silks, and too rich and too good for me, to be sure. I wish it was no Affront to him to make Money of them, and send it to you: it would do me more good.</p>
			<p>You will be full of Fears, I warrant now, of some Design upon me, till I tell you, that he was with Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> when he gave them me; and he gave her a Mort of good Things at the same Time, and bid her wear them in Remembrance of her good Friend, my Lady, his Mother. And when he gave me these fine Things, he said, These, <em class="italics">Pamela</em>, are for you; have them made fit for you, when your Mourning is laid by, and wear ’em for your good Mistress’s sake. Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> gives you a very good Word; and I would have you continue to behave as prudently as you have done hitherto, and every body will be your Friend.</p>
			<p>I was so surpris’d at his Goodness, that I could not tell what to say. I curcheed to him, and to Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> for her good Word; and said, I wish’d I might be deserving of his Favour, and her Kindness: And nothing should be wanting in me, to the best of my Knowledge.</p>
			<p>O how amiable a Thing is doing good!—It is all I envy great Folks for!</p>
			<p>I always thought my young Master a fine Gentleman, as every body says he is: But he gave these good Things to us both with such a Graciousness, as I thought he look’d like an Angel.</p>
			<p>Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> says, he ask’d her, If I kept the Men at a Distance; for he said, I was very pretty, and to be drawn in to have any of them, might be my Ruin, and make me poor and miserable betimes. She never is wanting to give me a good Word, and took Occasion to launch out in my Praise, she says. But I hope she said no more than I shall try to deserve, tho’ I mayn’t at present. I am sure I will always love her next to you and my dear Mother. So I rest,</p>
			<p class="right"><em class="italics">Your ever dutiful Daughter</em>.</p>
			<h3 class="h2"><small class="calibre2">LETTER VII</small>.</h3>
			<p class="indent1"><em class="italics">Dear Father</em>,</p>
			<p class="noindent">SINCE my last, my Master gave me more fine Things. He call’d me up to my old Lady’s Closet, and pulling out her Drawers, he gave me Two Suits of fine <em class="italics">Flanders</em> lac’d Headcloths, Three Pair of fine Silk Shoes, two hardly the worse, and just fit for me; for my old Lady had a very little Foot; and several Ribbands and Topknots of all Colours, and Four Pair of fine white Cotton Stockens, and Three Pair of fine Silk ones; and Two Pair of rich Stays, and a Pair of rich Silver Buckles in one Pair of the Shoes. I was quite astonish’d, and unable to speak for a while; but yet I was inwardly asham’d to take the Stockens; for Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> was not there: If she had, it would have been nothing. I believe I receiv’d them very awkwardly; for he smil’d at my Awkwardness; and said, Don’t blush, <em class="italics">Pamela</em>: Dost think I don’t know pretty Maids wear Shoes and Stockens?</p>
			<p>I was so confounded at these Words, you might have beat me down with a Feather. For, you must think, there was no Answer to be made to this: So, like a Fool, I was ready to cry; and went away curcheeing and blushing, I am sure, up to the Ears; for, tho’ there was no Harm in what he said, yet I did not know how to take it. But I went and told all to Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em>, who said, God put it into his Heart to be good to me; and I must double my Diligence. It look’d to her, she said, as if he would fit me in Dress for a Waiting-maid’s Place on his Sister Lady <em class="italics">Davers’s</em> own Person.</p>
			<p>But still your kind fatherly Cautions came into my Head, and made all these Gifts nothing near to me what they would have been. But yet I hope there is no Reason; for what Good could it do him to harm such a simple Maiden as me? Besides, to be sure, no Lady would look upon him, if he should so disgrace himself. So I will make myself easy; and indeed, I should never have been otherwise, if you had not put it into my Head; for my Good, I know very well. But, may be, without these Uneasinesses to mingle with these Benefits, I might be too much puff’d up: So I will conclude, All that happens is for our Good; and so God bless you, my dear Father and Mother; and I know you will pray to God to bless me; who am, and shall always be,</p>
			<p class="right"><em class="italics">Your dutiful Daughter</em>.</p>
			<h3 class="h2"><small class="calibre2">LETTER VIII</small>.</h3>
			<p class="indent1"><em class="italics">Dear</em> P<small class="calibre2">AMELA</small></p>
			<p class="noindent">I Cannot but renew my Cautions to you on your Master’s Kindness to you, and his free Expression to you about the Stockens. Yet there may not be, and I hope there is not, any thing in it. But when I reflect, that there <em class="italics">possibly</em> may, and that if there should, no less depends upon it than my Child’s everlasting Happiness in this World and the next; it is enough to make one fearful of the worst. Arm yourself, my dear Child, for the worst; and resolve to lose your Life sooner than your Virtue. What tho’ the Doubts I fill’d you with, lessen the Pleasure you would have had in your Master’s Kindness, yet what signify the Delights that arise from a few paltry fine Cloaths, in Comparison with a good Conscience?</p>
			<p>These are indeed very great Favours that he heaps upon you, but so much the more to be suspected; and when you say he look’d so amiable, and like an Angel, how afraid I am, that they should make too great an Impression upon you! For, tho’ God has bless’d you with Sense and Prudence above your Years, yet, I tremble to think what a sad Hazard a poor Maiden of no more than Fifteen Years of Age stands against the Temptations of this World, and a designing young Gentleman, if he should prove so, who has so much Power to oblige, and has a kind of Authority to command as your Master.</p>
			<p>I charge you, my dear Child, on both our Blessings, poor as we are, to be on your Guard; there can be no Harm in that: and since Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> is so good a Gentlewoman, and so kind to you, I am the easier a great deal, and so is your Mother; and we hope you will hide nothing from her, and take her Counsel in every thing. So with our Blessings and assured Prayers for you, more than for ourselves, we remain</p>
			<p class="right"><em class="italics">Your loving Father and Mother</em>.</p>
			<p class="hangingpara">Besure don’t let People’s telling you you are pretty, puff you up: for you did not make yourself, and so can have no Praise due to you for it. It is Virtue and Goodness only, that make the true Beauty. Remember that, <em class="italics">Pamela</em>.</p>
			<h3 class="h2"><small class="calibre2">LETTER IX</small>.</h3>
			<p class="indent1"><em class="italics">Dear Father and Mother</em>,</p>
			<p class="noindent">I Am sorry to write you word, that the Hopes I had of going to wait on Lady <em class="italics">Davers</em> are quite over. My Lady would have had me; but my Master, as I hear by the bye, would not consent to it. He said, Her Nephew might be taken with me, and I might draw him in, or be drawn in by him; and he thought, as his Mother lov’d me, and committed me to his Care, he ought to continue me with him; and Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> would be a Mother to me. Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> tells me, the Lady shook her Head, and said, <em class="italics">Ah! Brother!</em> and that was all. And as you have made me fearful by your Cautions, my Heart at times misgives me. But I say nothing yet of your Caution, or my own Uneasiness, to Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis;</em> not that I mistrust her, but for fear she should think me presumptuous, and vain, and conceited, to have any Fears about the matter, from the great Distance between so great a Man, and so poor a Girl. But yet Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> seem’d to build something upon Lady <em class="italics">Davers</em>’ shaking her Head, and saying, <em class="italics">Ah! Brother</em>, and no more! God, I hope, will give me his Grace; and so I will not, if I can help it, make myself too uneasy; for I hope there is no Occasion. But every little matter that happens, I will acquaint you with, that you shall continue to me your good Advice, and pray for</p>

			<p class="indent1"><em class="italics">Dear Mother</em>,</p>
			<p class="noindent">YOU and my good Father may wonder that you have not had a Letter from me in so many Weeks; but a sad, sad Scene has been the Occasion of it. For, to be sure, now it is too plain, that all your Cautions were well-grounded. O my dear Mother! I am miserable, truly miserable!—But yet, don’t be frighted, I am honest!—God, of his Goodness, keep me so!</p>
			<p>O this Angel of a Master! this fine Gentleman! this gracious Benefactor to your poor <em class="italics">Pamela!</em> who was to take care of me at the Prayer of his good dying Mother; who was so careful of me, lest I should be drawn in by Lord <em class="italics">Davers’s</em> Nephew; that he would not let me go to Lady <em class="italics">Davers’s</em>: This very Gentleman (yes, I must call him Gentleman, tho’ he has fallen from the Merit of that Title) has degraded himself to offer Freedoms to his poor Servant! He has now shew’d himself in his true Colours, and to me, nothing appears so black and so frightful.</p>
			<p>I have not been idle; but have writ from time to time how he, by sly mean Degrees, exposed his wicked Views: But somebody stole my Letter, and I know not what is become of it. It was a very long one. I fear he that was mean enough to do bad things, in one respect, did not stick at this; but be it as it will, all the Use he can make of it will be, that he may be asham’d of <em class="italics">his</em> Part; I not of <em class="italics">mine</em>. For he will see I was resolv’d to be honest, and glory’d in the Honesty of my poor Parents. I will tell you all, the next Opportunity; for I am watch’d, and such-like, very narrowly; and he says to Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em>, This Girl is always scribbling; I think she may be better employ’d. And yet I work all Hours with my Needle, upon his Linen, and the fine Linen of the Family; and am besides about flowering him a Waistcoat.—But, Oh! my Heart’s broke almost; for what am I likely to have for my Reward, but Shame and Disgrace, or else ill Words, and hard Treatment! I’ll tell you all soon, and hope I shall find my long Letter.</p>

			<p>I must <em class="italics">he</em> and <em class="italics">him</em> him now; for he has lost his Dignity with me!</p>
			<h3 class="h2"><small class="calibre2">LETTER XI</small>.</h3>
			<p class="indent1"><em class="italics">Dear Mother</em>,</p>
			<p class="noindent">WELL, I can’t find my Letter, and so I’ll tell you all, as briefly as I can. All went well enough in the main for some time after my last Letter but one. At last, I saw some Reason to suspect; for he would look upon me, whenever he saw me, in such a manner, as shew’d not well; and at last he came to me, as I was in the Summer-house in the little Garden, at work with my Needle, and Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> was just gone from me; and I would have gone out; but he said, No, don’t go, <em class="italics">Pamela;</em> I have something to say to you; and you always fly me so, whenever I come near you, as if you was afraid of me.</p>
			<p>I was all confounded; and said at last; It does not become your poor Servant to stay in your Presence, Sir, without your Business requir’d it; and I hope I shall always know my Place.</p>
			<p>Well, says he, my Business does require it sometimes, and I have a mind you should stay to hear what I have to say to you.</p>
			<p>I stood all confounded, and began to tremble, and the more when he took me by the Hand; for now no Soul was near us.</p>
			<p>My Sister <em class="italics">Davers</em>, said he, (and seem’d, I thought, to be as much at a Loss for Words as I) would have had you live with her; but she would not do for you what I am resolv’d to do, if you continue faithful and obliging. What say’st thou, my Girl, said he, with some Eagerness, hadst thou not rather stay with me than go to my Sister <em class="italics">Davers?</em> He look’d so, as fill’d me with Affrightment; I don’t know how; wildly I thought.</p>
			<p>I said, when I could speak, Your Honour will forgive your poor Servant; but as you have no Lady for me to wait upon, and my good Lady has been now dead this Twelve-month, I had rather, if it would not displease you, wait upon Lady <em class="italics">Davers, because</em>——</p>
			<p>I was proceeding; and he said a little hastily—<em class="italics">Because</em> you’re a little Fool, and know not what’s good for yourself. I tell you, I will make a Gentlewoman of you, if you be obliging, and don’t stand in your own Light; and so saying, he put his Arm about me, and kiss’d me!</p>
			<p>Now you will say, all his Wickedness appear’d plainly. I struggled, and trembled, and was so benumb’d with Terror, that I sunk down, not in a Fit, and yet not myself; and I found myself in his Arms, quite void of Strength, and he kissed me two or three times, as if he would have eaten me.—At last I burst from him, and was getting out of the Summer-house; but he held me back, and shut the Door.</p>
			<p>I would have given my Life for a Farthing. And he said, I’ll do you no Harm, <em class="italics">Pamela;</em> don’t be afraid of me. I said, I won’t stay! You won’t, Hussy, said he! Do you know who you speak to! I lost all Fear, and all Respect, and said, Yes, I do, Sir, too well!—Well may I forget that I am your Servant, when you forget what belongs to a Master.</p>
			<p>I sobb’d and cry’d most sadly. What a foolish Hussy you are, said he, have I done you any Harm?—Yes, Sir, said I, the greatest Harm in the World: You have taught me to forget myself, and what belongs to me, and have lessen’d the Distance that Fortune has made between us, by demeaning yourself, to be so free to a poor Servant. Yet, Sir, said I, I will be so bold to say, I am honest, tho’ poor; And if you was a Prince, I would not be otherwise.</p>
			<p>He was angry, and said, Who would have you otherwise, you foolish Slut! Cease your blubbering! I own I have demean’d myself; but it was only to try you: If you can keep this Matter secret, you’ll give me the better Opinion of your Prudence; and here’s something, said he, putting some Gold in my Hand, to make you Amends for the Fright I put you to. Go, take a Walk in the Garden, and don’t go in till your blubbering is over: And I charge you say nothing of what has past, and all shall be well, and I’ll forgive you.</p>
			<p>I won’t take the Money, indeed, Sir, said I; poor as I am! I won’t take it: for to say Truth, I thought it look’d like taking Earnest; and so I put it upon the Bench; and as he seem’d vex’d and confus’d at what he had done, I took the Opportunity to open the Door, and went out of the Summer-house.</p>
			<p>He called to me, and said, Be secret, I charge you, <em class="italics">Pamela;</em> and don’t go in yet, as I told you.</p>
			<p>O how poor and mean must these Actions be, and how little must they make the best of Gentlemen look, when they offer such things as are unworthy of themselves, and put it into the Power of their Inferiors to be greater than they!</p>
			<p>I took a Turn or two in the Garden, but in Sight of the House for fear of the worst, and breathed upon my Hand to dry my Eyes, because I would not be too disobedient. My next shall tell you more.</p>
			<p>Pray for me, my dear Father and Mother; and don’t be angry I have not yet run away from this House, so late my Comfort and Delight, but now my Anguish and Terror. I am forc’d to break off, hastily,</p>
			<p class="right"><em class="italics">Your dutiful and honest Daughter</em>.</p>
			<h3 class="h2"><small class="calibre2">LETTER XII</small>.</h3>
			<p class="indent1"><em class="italics">Dear Mother</em>,</p>
			<p class="noindent">WELL, I will now proceed with my sad Story. And so after I had dry’d my Eyes, I went in, and begun to ruminate with myself what I had best to do. Sometimes I thought I would leave the House, and go to the next Town, and wait an Opportunity to get to you; but then I was at a Loss to resolve whether to take away the Things he had given me or no, and how to take them away: Sometimes I thought to leave them behind me, and only go with the Cloaths on my Back; but then I had two Miles and a half, and a By-way, to go to the Town; and being pretty well dress’d, I might come to some harm, almost as bad as what I would run away from; and then may-be, thought I, it will be reported, I have stolen something, and so was forc’d to run away; and to carry a bad Name back with me to my dear poor Parents, would be a sad thing indeed!—O how I wish’d for my grey Russet again, and my poor honest Dress, with which you fitted me out, and hard enough too you had to do it, God knows, for going to this Place, when I was but twelve Years old, in my good Lady’s Days! Sometimes I thought of telling Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em>, and taking her Advice, and only feared his Command, to be secret; for, thought I, he may be ashamed of his Actions, and never attempt the like again: And as poor Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> depended upon him, thro’ Misfortunes that had attended her, I thought it would be a sad thing to bring his Displeasure upon her for my sake.</p>
			<p>In this Quandary, now considering, now crying, and not knowing what to do, I pass’d the Time in my Chamber till Evening; when desiring to be excused going to Supper, Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> came up to me; and said, Why must I sup without you, <em class="italics">Pamela?</em> Come, I see you are troubled at something; tell me what is the Matter.</p>
			<p>I begg’d I might be permitted to lie with her on Nights; for I was afraid of Spirits, and they would not hurt such a good Person as she. That was a silly Excuse, she said; for why was you not afraid of Spirits before? Indeed I did not think of that. But you shall be my Bedfellow with all my Heart, said she, let your Reason be what it will; only come down to Supper. I begg’d to be excus’d; for, said I, I have been crying so, that it will be taken Notice of by my Fellow-servants; and I will hide nothing from you, Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em>, when we are a-bed.</p>
			<p>She was so good to indulge me, and went down to Supper; but made more haste to come up to-bed; and told the Servants, that I should lie with her, because she said she could not rest well, and she would get me to read her to sleep, because she knew I lov’d reading, as she said.</p>
			<p>When we were alone, I told her every bit and crumb of the Matter; for I thought, tho’ he had bid me not, yet if he should come to know I had told, it would be no worse; for to keep a Secret of such a Nature, I thought would be to deprive myself of the good Advice which I never wanted more; and might encourage him to think I did not resent it as I ought, and would keep worse Secrets, and so make him do worse by me. Was I right, my dear Mother?</p>
			<p>Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> could not help mingling Tears with my Tears; for I cry’d all the Time I told her the Story; and begg’d her to advise me what to do; and I shew’d her my dear Father’s two Letters, and she praised the Honesty and Inditing of them; and said pleasing things to me of you both. But she begg’d I would not think of leaving my Service; for, says she, in all Likelihood, you behav’d so virtuously, that he will be asham’d of what he has done, and never offer the like to you again: Tho’, my dear <em class="italics">Pamela</em>, said she, I fear more for your Prettiness than for any thing else; because the best Man in the Land might love you; so she was pleased to say. She said she wished it was in her Power to live independent; that then she would take a little private House, and I should live with her like her Daughter.</p>
			<p>And so, as you order’d me to take her Advice, I resolved to tarry to see how things went, without he was to turn me away; altho’, in your first Letter, you order’d me to come away the Moment I had any Reason to be apprehensive. So, dear Father and Mother, it is not Disobedience, I hope, that I stay; for I could not expect a Blessing, or the good Fruits of your Prayers for me, if I was disobedient.</p>
			<p>All the next Day I was very sad, and began to write my long Letter. He saw me writing, and said (as I mention’d) to Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em>, That Girl is always scribbling; methinks she might find something else to do, or to that purpose. And when I had finish’d my Letter, I put it under the Toilet, in my late Lady’s Dressing-room, where nobody comes but myself and Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em>, besides my Master; but when I came up again to seal it up, to my great Concern it was gone; and Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> knew nothing of it; and nobody knew of my Master’s having been near the Place in the time; so I have been sadly troubled about it: But Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em>, as well as I, thinks he has it some how or other; and he appears cross and angry, and seems to shun me, as much as he said I did him. It had better be so than worse!</p>
			<p>But he has order’d Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> to bid me not spend so much time in writing; which is a poor Matter for such a Gentleman as he to take notice of, as I am not idle otherways, if he did not resent what he thought I wrote upon. And this has no very good Look.</p>
			<p>But I am a good deal easier since I lie with Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis;</em> tho’ after all, the Fears I live in on one side, and his Frowning and Displeasure at what I do on the other, makes me more miserable than enough.</p>
			<p>O that I had never left my Rags nor my Poverty, to be thus expos’d to Temptations on one hand, or Disgusts on the other! How happy was I a-while ago! How miserable now!—Pity and pray for</p>
			<p class="right"><em class="italics">Your afflicted</em> P<small class="calibre2">AMELA</small>.</p>
			<h3 class="h2"><small class="calibre2">LETTER XIII</small>.</h3>
			<p class="indent1"><em class="italics">My dearest Child</em>,</p>
			<p class="noindent">OUR Hearts bleed for your Distress and the Temptations you are tried with. You have our hourly Prayers; and we would have you flee this evil Great House and Man, if you find he renews his Attempts. You ought to have done it at first, had you not had Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> to advise with. We can find no Fault in your Conduct hitherto: But it makes our Hearts ake for fear of the worst. O my Child! Temptations are sore things; but yet without them, we know not our selves, nor what we are able to do.</p>
			<p>Your Temptations are very great; for you have Riches, Youth, and a fine Gentleman, as the World reckons him, to withstand; but how great will be your Honour to withstand them! And when we consider your past Conduct, and your virtuous Education, and that you have been bred to be more asham’d of Dishonesty than Poverty, we trust in God that he will enable you to overcome. Yet, as we can’t see but your Life must be a Burden to you, through the great Apprehensions always upon you; and that it may be presumptuous to trust too much to your own Strength; and that you are but very young; and the Devil may put it into his Head to use some Stratagem, of which great Men are full, to decoy you; I think you had best come home to share our Poverty with Safety, than to live with so much Discontent in a Plenty, that itself may be dangerous. God direct you for the best. While you have Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> for an Adviser, and Bedfellow, (and, O my dear Child, that was prudently done of you) we are easier than we should be; and so committing you to God’s blessed Protection, remain</p>
			<p class="right"><em class="italics">Your truly loving</em>.<br class="calibre3"/><em class="italics">but careful, Father and Mother</em>.</p>
			<h3 class="h2"><small class="calibre2">LETTER XIV</small>.</h3>
			<p class="indent1"><em class="italics">Dear Father and Mother</em>,</p>
			<p class="noindent">MRS. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> and I have liv’d very comfortably together for this Fortnight past; for my Master was all that time at his <em class="italics">Lincolnshire</em> Estate, and at his Sister’s the Lady <em class="italics">Davers</em>. But he came home Yesterday. He had some Talk with Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> soon after he came home; and mostly about me. He said to her, it seems, Well, Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em>, I know <em class="italics">Pamela</em> has your good Word; but do you think her of any Use in the Family? She told me, she was surpris’d at the Question; but said, That I was one of the most virtuous and industrious young Creatures that ever she knew. Why that Word <em class="italics">virtuous</em>, said he, I pray you? Was there any Reason to suppose her otherwise? Or has any body taken it into their Heads to try her?—I wonder, Sir, says she, you ask me such a Question! Who dare offer any thing to her in such an orderly and well-govern’d House as yours, and under a Master of so good a Character for Virtue and Honour? Your Servant, Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em>, says he, for your good Opinion; but pray, if any body did, do you think <em class="italics">Pamela</em> would let you know it? Why, Sir, said she; she is a poor innocent young Thing, and I believe has so much Confidence in me, that she would take my Advice as soon as she would her Mother’s. <em class="italics">Innocent!</em> again; and <em class="italics">virtuous</em>, I warrant! Well, Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em>, you abound with your Epithets; but ’tis my Opinion, she is an artful young Baggage; and had I a young handsome Butler or Steward, she’d soon make her Market of one of them, if she thought it worth while to snap at him for a Husband. Alack-a-day, Sir, said she, ’tis early Days with <em class="italics">Pamela</em>, and she does not yet think of a Husband, I dare say: And your Steward and Butler are both Men in Years, and think nothing of the Matter. No, said he, if they were younger, they’d have more Wit than to think of such a Girl. I’ll tell you my Mind of her, Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em>, I don’t think this same Favourite of yours so very artless a Girl, as you imagine. I am not to dispute with your Honour about her, said Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis;</em> but I dare say, if the Men will let her alone, she’ll never trouble herself about them. Why, Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em>, said he, are there any Men that will not let her alone that you know of? No, indeed, Sir, said she; she keeps herself so much to herself, and yet behaves so prudently, that they all esteem her, and shew her as great Respect as if she was a Gentlewoman born.</p>
			<p>Ay, says he, that’s her Art, that I was speaking of: But let me tell you, the Girl has Vanity and Conceit, and Pride too, or I am mistaken; and I could give you perhaps an Instance of it. Sir, said she, you can see further than such a poor silly Woman as me; but I never saw any thing but Innocence in her.—And <em class="italics">Virtue</em> too, I’ll warrant ye, said he. But suppose I could give you an Instance, where she has talk’d a little too freely of the Kindnesses that have been shew’d her from a <em class="italics">certain Quarter;</em> and has had the Vanity to impute a few kind Words utter’d in mere Compassion to her Youth and Circumstances, into a Design upon her, and even dar’d to make free with Names that she ought never to mention but with Reverence and Gratitude; what would you say to that?—Say, Sir! said she, I cannot tell what to say. But I hope <em class="italics">Pamela</em> incapable of such Ingratitude.</p>
			<p>Well, no more of this silly Girl, says he; you may only advise her, as you are her Friend, not to give herself too much Licence upon the Favours she meets with; and if she stays here, that she will not write the Affairs of my Family purely for an Exercise to her Pen and her Invention. I tell you, she is a subtle artful Gypsey, and time will shew it you.</p>
			<p>Was ever the like heard, my dear Father and Mother? It is plain he did not expect to meet with such a Repulse, and mistrusts that I have told Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em>, and has my long Letter too that I intended for you; and so is vex’d to the Heart. But, however, I can’t help it. So I had better be thought artful and subtle, than be so, in <em class="italics">his</em> Sense; and as light as he makes of the Words <em class="italics">Virtue</em> and <em class="italics">Innocence</em> in me, he would have made a less angry Construction, had I less deserved that he should do so; for then, may be, my <em class="italics">Crime</em> would have been my <em class="italics">Virtue</em> with him; naughty Gentleman as he is!—I will soon write again; but must now end with saying, That I am, and shall always be,</p>
			<p class="right"><em class="italics">Your honest Daughter</em>.</p>
			<h3 class="h2"><small class="calibre2">LETTER XV</small>.</h3>
			<p class="indent1"><em class="italics">Dear Mother</em>,</p>
			<p class="noindent">I Broke off abruptly my last Letter; for I fear’d he was coming; and so it happen’d. I thrust the Letter into my Bosom, and took up my Work, which lay by me; but I had so little of the Artful, as he called it, that I look’d as confused, as if I had been doing some great Harm.</p>
			<p></a>Sit still, <em class="italics">Pamela</em>, said he, and mind your Work, for all me.—You don’t tell me I am welcome home after my Journey to <em class="italics">Lincolnshire</em>. It would be hard, Sir, said I, if you was not always welcome to your Honour’s own House.</p>
			<p>I would have gone; but he said, Don’t run away, I tell you. I have a Word or two to say to you. Good Sirs, how my Heart went pit-a-pat! When I was a <em class="italics">little kind</em>, said he, to you in the Summer-house, and you carry’d yourself so <em class="italics">foolishly</em> upon it, as if I had intended to do you great harm, did I not tell you, you should take no Notice of what pass’d, to any Creature? And yet you have made a common Talk of the Matter, not considering either my Reputation or your own.—I made a common Talk of it, Sir, said I! I have nobody to talk to, hardly!</p>
			<p>He interrupted me, and said, <em class="italics">Hardly!</em> you little Equivocator! what do you mean by <em class="italics">hardly?</em> Let me ask you, Have you not told Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> for one? Pray your Honour, said I, all in Agitation, let me go down; for ’tis not for me to hold an Argument with your Honour. Equivocator, again! said he, and took my Hand, what do you talk of an <em class="italics">Argument?</em> Is it holding an Argument with me, to answer a plain Question? Answer me what I asked. O good, Sir, said I, let me beg you will not urge me further, for fear I forget myself again, and be sawcy.</p>
			<p>Answer me then, I bid you, says he, Have you told Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis?</em> It will be sawcy in you, if you don’t answer me directly to what I ask. Sir, said I, and fain would have pulled my Hand away, may be I should be for answering you by another Question, and that would not become me. What is it, says he, you would say? Speak out!</p>
			<p>Then, Sir, said I, why should your Honour be so angry I should tell Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em>, or any body else, what passed, if you intended no harm?</p>
			<p>Well said, pretty <em class="italics">Innocent</em> and <em class="italics">Artless!</em> as Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> calls you, said he; and is it thus you taunt and retort upon me, insolent as you are! But still I will be answered directly to my Question? Why then, Sir, said I, I will not tell a Lye for the World: I did tell Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis;</em> for my Heart was almost broke; but I open’d not my Mouth to any other. Very well, Boldface, said he, and Equivocator, again! You did not open your Mouth to any other; but did you not <em class="italics">write</em> to some other? Why now, and please your Honour, said I, (for I was quite courageous just then) you could not have asked me this Question, if you had
			not taken from me my Letter to my Father and Mother, in which, I own, I had broke my Mind freely to them, and asked their Advice, and poured forth my Griefs!</p>
			<p>And so I am to be exposed, am I, said he, <em class="italics">in</em> my House, and <em class="italics">out</em> of my House, to the whole World, by such a Sawcebox as you? No, good Sir, said I, and I hope your Honour won’t be angry with me; it is not me that expose you if I say nothing but the Truth. So, taunting again! Assurance as you are, said he! I will not be thus talk’d to.</p>
			<p>Pray, Sir, said I, who can a poor Girl take Advice of, if it must not be of her Father and Mother, and such a good Woman as Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em>, who for her Sex-sake, should give it me when asked? Insolence! said he, and stamp’d with his Foot, Am I to be question’d thus by such a one as you? I fell down on my Knees, and said, For God’s sake, your Honour, pity a poor distressed Creature, that knows nothing of her Duty, but how to cherish her Virtue and good Name! I have nothing else to trust to; and tho’ poor and friendless here, yet I have always been taught to value Honesty above my Life. Here’s ado with your Honesty, said he, foolish Girl! Is it not one Part of Honesty, to be dutiful and grateful to your Master, do you think? Indeed, Sir, said I, it is impossible I should be ingrateful to your Honour, or disobedient, or deserve the Names of Boldface and Insolent, which you call me, but when your Commands are contrary to that first Duty, which shall ever be the Principle of my Life!</p>
			<p>He seem’d to be moved, and rose up, and walked into the great Chamber two or three Turns, leaving me on my Knees; and I threw my Apron over my Face, and laid my Head on a Chair, and cry’d as if my Heart would break, having no Power to stir.</p>
			<p>At last he came in again, but, alas! with Mischief in his Heart! and raising me up, he said, Rise, <em class="italics">Pamela</em>, rise; you are your own Enemy. Your perverse Folly will be your Ruin! I tell you this, that I am very much displeased with the Freedoms you have taken with my Name to my House-keeper, as also to your Father and Mother; and you may as well have <em class="italics">real</em> Cause to take these Freedoms with me, as to make my Name suffer for imaginary ones: And saying so, he offer’d to take me on his Knee, with some Force. O how I was terrify’d! I said, like as I had read in a Book a Night or two before, Angels, and Saints, and all the Host of Heaven, defend me!<a href="part0021_split_008.html#exp-note-8" class="nounder">*</a> And may I never survive one Moment, that fatal one in which I shall forfeit my Innocence. Pretty Fool! said he, how will you forfeit your Innocence, if you are oblig’d to yield to a Force you cannot withstand? Be easy, said he; for let the worst happen that can, you’ll have the Merit, and I the Blame; and it will be a good Subject for Letters to your Father and Mother, and a Tale into the Bargain for Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em>.</p>
			<p>He by Force kissed my Neck and Lips; and said, Who ever blamed <em class="italics">Lucretia<a id="exp-note_9"></a><a href="part0021_split_009.html#exp-note-9" class="nounder">*</a></em> but the <em class="italics">Ravisher</em> only? and I am content to take all the Blame upon me; as I have already borne too great a Share for what I have deserv’d. May I, said I, <em class="italics">Lucretia</em> like, justify myself with my Death, if I am used barbarously? O my good Girl! said he, tauntingly, you are well read, I see; and we shall make out between us, before we have done, a pretty Story in Romance, I warrant ye!</p>
			<p>He then put his Hand in my Bosom, and the Indignation gave me double Strength, and I got loose from him, by a sudden Spring, and ran out of the Room; and the next Chamber being open, I made shift to get into it, and threw-to the Door, and the Key being on the Inside, it locked; but he follow’d me so close, he got hold of my Gown, and tore a Piece off, which hung without the Door.</p>
			<p>I just remember I got into the Room; for I knew nothing further of the Matter till afterwards; for I fell into a Fit with my Fright and Terror, and there I lay, till he, as I suppose, looking through the Keyhole, spy’d me lying all along upon the Floor, stretch’d out at my Length; and then he call’d Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> to me, who, by his Assistance, bursting open the Door, he went away, seeing me coming to myself; and bid her say nothing of the Matter, if she was wise.</p>
			<p>Poor Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> thought it was worse, and cry’d over me like as if she was my Mother; and I was two Hours before I came to myself; and just as I got a little up on my Feet, he coming in, I went away again with the Terror; and so he withdrew again: But he staid in the next Room to let nobody come near us, that his foul Proceedings might not be known.</p>
			<p>Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> gave me her Smelling-bottle, and had cut my Laces, and sat me in a great Chair, and he call’d her to him: How is the Girl, said he? I never saw such a Fool in my Life. I did nothing at all to her. Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> could not speak for crying. So, he said, she has told you, it seems, that I was kind to her in the Summer-house, tho’ I’ll assure you, I was quite innocent then as well as now; and I desire you to keep this Matter to yourself, and let me not be nam’d in it.</p>
			<p>O Sir, said she, for your Honour’s sake, and for Christ’s sake—But he would not hear her, and said—For your own sake, I tell you, Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em>, say not a Word more. I have done her no harm. And I won’t have her stay in my House; prating, perverse Fool, as she is! But since she is so apt to fall into Fits, or at least pretend to do so, prepare her to see me To-morrow after Dinner, in my Mother’s Closet, and do you be with her, and you shall hear what passes between us.</p>
			<p>And so he went out in a Pet, and order’d his Chariot and Four to be got ready, and went away a Visiting somewhere.</p>
			<p>Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> then came to me, and I told her all that had happen’d, and said I was resolv’d not to stay in the House; and she saying, He seem’d to threaten as much; I said, Thank God; then I shall be easy: So she told me all he had said to her, as I have said above.</p>
			<p>Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> is very loth I should go; and yet, poor Woman! she begins to be afraid for herself; but would not have me ruin’d for the World. She says, To be sure he means no good; but may be, now he sees me so resolute, he will give over all Attempts: And that I shall know what to do better after To-morrow, when I am to appear before a very bad Judge, I doubt!</p>
			<p>O how I dread this To-morrow’s Appearance! But be assured, my dear Parents, of the Honesty of your poor Child! As I am sure I am of your Prayers for</p>
			<p class="right"><em class="italics">Your dutiful Daughter</em>.</p>
			<p>Oh! this frightful To-morrow! how I dread it!</p>

			<p class="indent1"><em class="italics">My dear Parents</em>,</p>
			<p class="noindent">I Know you longed to hear from me soon. I send as soon as I could.</p>
			<p>Well, you may believe how uneasily I passed the Time till his appointed Hour came. Every Minute, as it grew nearer, my Terrors increased; and sometimes I had great Courage, and sometimes none at all; and I thought I should faint when it came to the Time my Master had dined. I could neither eat nor drink, for my part; and do what I could, my Eyes were swell’d with crying.</p>
			<p>At last he went up to the Closet, which was my good Lady’s Dressing-room; a Room I once lov’d, but then as much hated.</p>
			<p>Don’t your Heart ake for me?—I am sure mine flutter’d about like a Bird in a Cage new caught. O <em class="italics">Pamela</em>, said I to my self, why art thou so foolish and fearful! Thou hast done no harm! what, if thou fearest an unjust Judge,<a id="exp-note_10"></a><a href="part0021_split_010.html#exp-note-10" class="nounder">*</a> when thou art innocent, wouldst thou do before a just one, if thou wert guilty? Have Courage, <em class="italics">Pamela</em>, thou knowest the worst! And how easy a Choice Poverty and Honesty is, rather than Plenty and Wickedness?</p>
			<p>So I chear’d myself; but yet my poor Heart sunk, and my Spirits were quite broken. Every thing that stirred, I thought was to call me to my Account. I dreaded it, and yet I wished it to come.</p>
			<p>Well, at last he rung the Bell; O thought I, that it was my Passing-bell! Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> went up, with a full Heart enough, poor good Woman! He said, Where’s <em class="italics">Pamela?</em> let her come up, and do you come with her. She came to me; I was ready to come with my Feet, but my Heart was with my dear Father and Mother, wishing to share your Poverty and Happiness. But I went.</p>
			<p>O how can wicked Men look so steddy and untouch’d, with such black Hearts, while poor Innocents look like Malefactors before them!</p>
			<p>He looked so stern, that my Heart failed me, and I wish’d myself any-where but there, tho’ I had before been summoning up all my Courage. Good God of Heaven, said I to myself, give me Courage to stand before this naughty Master! O soften him! or harden me!</p>
			<p>Come in, Fool, said he, angrily, as soon as he saw me (and snatch’d my Hand with a Pull); you may well be asham’d to see me, after your Noise and Nonsense, and exposing me as you have done. <em class="italics">I</em> ashamed to see <em class="italics">you!</em> thought I: Very pretty indeed!—But I said nothing.</p>
			<p>Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em>, said he, here you are both together. Do you sit down; but let her stand if she will: Ay, thought I, if I <em class="italics">can;</em> for my Knees beat one against another. Did you not think, when you saw the Girl in the way you found her in, that I had given her the greatest Occasion that could possibly be given any Woman? And that I had actually ruin’d her, as she calls it? Tell me, could you think any thing less? Indeed, says she, I fear’d so at first. Has she told you what I did to her, and <em class="italics">all</em> I did to her, to occasion all this Folly, by which my Reputation might have suffer’d in your Opinion, and in that of all the Family?—Tell me, what has she told you?</p>
			<p>She was a little too much frighted, as she owned afterwards, at his Sternness, and said, Indeed she told me you only pulled her on your Knee, and kissed her.</p>
			<p>Then I plucked up my Spirit a little. <em class="italics">Only!</em> Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em>, said I, and was not that enough to shew me what I had to fear! When a Master of his Honour’s Degree demeans himself to be so free as that to such a poor Servant as me, what is the next to be expected?—But your Honour went further, so you did; and threaten’d what you would do, and talk’d of <em class="italics">Lucretia</em>, and her hard Fate.—Your Honour knows you went too far for a Master to a Servant, or even to his Equal; and I cannot bear it! So I fell a crying most sadly.</p>
			<p>Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> began to excuse me, and to beg he would pity a poor Maiden, that had such a Value for her Reputation. He said, I speak it to her Face, I think her very pretty, and I thought her humble, and one that would not grow upon my Favours, or the Notice I took of her; but I abhor the Thought of forcing her to any thing. I know myself better, said he, and what belongs to me: And to be sure I have enough demean’d myself to take so much Notice of such a one as she; but I was bewitch’d, I think, by her, to be freer than became me; tho’ I had no Intention to carry the Jest farther.</p>
			<p>What poor Stuff was all this, my dear Mother, from a Man of his Sense! But see how a bad Cause and bad Actions confound the greatest Wits!—It gave me a little more Courage then; for Innocence, I find, in a weak Mind, has many Advantages over Guilt, with all its Riches and Wisdom!</p>
			<p>So I said, Your Honour may call this Jest or Sport, or what you please; but indeed, Sir, it is not a Jest that becomes the Distance between a Master and a Servant! Do you hear, Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em>, said he? Do you hear the Pertness of the Creature? I had a good deal of this Sort before in the Summer-house, and Yesterday too, which made me rougher to her than perhaps I had otherwise been.</p>
			<p>Says Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis, Pamela</em>, don’t be pert to his Honour! You should know your Distance; you see his Honour was only in jest!—O dear Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em>, said I, don’t you blame me too! It is very difficult to keep one’s Distance to the greatest of Men, when they won’t keep it themselves to their meanest Servants!</p>
			<p>See again, said he; could you believe this of the young Baggage, if you had not heard it. O good your Honour, said the well-meaning Gentlewoman, pity and forgive the poor Girl; she is but a Girl; and her Virtue is very dear to her; and I will pawn my Life for her, she will never be pert to your Honour, if you’ll be so good as to molest her no more, nor frighten her again. Said she, You see how, by her Fit, she was in Terror; she could not help it; and tho’ your Honour intended her no harm; yet the Apprehension was almost Death to her: And I had much ado to bring her to herself again. O the little Hypocrite, said he! she has all the Arts of her Sex; they are born with her; and I told you a-while ago, you did not know her. But, said he, this was not the Reason principally of my calling you before me both together: I find I am likely to suffer in my Reputation by the Perverseness and Folly of this Girl. She has told you all, and perhaps more than all; nay, I make no doubt of it; and she has written Letters; for I find she is a mighty Letter-writer! to her Father and Mother, and others, as far as I know; in which she makes herself an Angel of Light, and me, her kind Master and Benefactor, a Devil incarnate!—(O how People will sometimes, thought I, call themselves by the right Names!—) And all this I won’t bear; and so I am resolv’d she shall return to the Distresses and Poverty she was taken from; and let her take care how she uses my Name with Freedom, when she is gone from me.</p>
			<p>I was brighten’d up at once upon these welcome Words: And I threw myself upon my Knees at his Feet, with a most sincere, glad Heart; and I said, God Almighty bless your Honour for your Resolution: Now I shall be happy; and permit me, on my bended Knees, to thank your Honour for all the Benefits and Favours you have heaped upon me: For the Opportunities I have had of Improvement and Learning; through my good Lady’s Means, and yours. I will now forget all your Honour has done to me: And I promise you, that I will never take your Name in my Lips, but with Reverence and Gratitude: And so God Almighty bless your Honour, for ever and ever, <em class="italics">Amen!</em>—And so I got up, and went away with another-guise sort of Heart than I came into his Presence with. And so I fell to writing this Letter. And thank God all is over.</p>
			<p>And now my dearest Father and Mother, expect to see soon your poor Daughter, with an humble and dutiful Mind, return’d to you: And don’t fear but I know how to be happy with you as ever: For I will lie in the Loft, as I used to do; and pray let the little Bed be got ready; and I have a little Money, which will buy me a Suit of Cloaths, fitter for my Condition than what I have; and I will get Mrs. <em class="italics">Mum-ford</em> to help me to some Needle-work; and fear not that I shall be a Burden to you, if my Health continues; and I know God will bless me, if not for my own sake, for both your sakes, who have, in all your Trials and Misfortunes, preserved so much Integrity, as makes every body speak well of you both. But I hope he will let good Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> give me a Character, for fear it should be thought I was turn’d away for Dishonesty.</p>
			<p>And so God bless you both, and may you be blest for me, and I blest for you: And I will always bless my Master and Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em>. And so good Night; for it is late, and I shall be soon called to-bed.</p>
			<p>I hope Mrs. <em class="italics">Jervis</em> is not angry with me, because she has not called me to Supper with her; tho’ I could eat nothing if she had. But I make no doubt I shall sleep purely to Night, and dream that I am with you, in my dear, dear, happy Loft once more.</p>
			<p>So, good Night again, my dear Father and Mother, says</p>
			<p class="right"><em class="italics">Your honest poor Daughter</em>.</p>
			<p class="hangingpara">May-hap I mayn’t come this Week, because I must get up the Linen, and leave every thing belonging to my Place in Order. So send me a Line if you can, to let me know if I shall be welcome, by <em class="italics">John</em>, who’ll call for it as he returns. But say nothing of my coming away to him, as yet. For it will be said I blab every thing.</p>
