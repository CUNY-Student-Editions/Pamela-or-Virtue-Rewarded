<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">I am now come down in my Writing to this present SATURDAY, and a deal I have written</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">My wicked Bed-fellow has very punctual Orders it seems; for she locks me and herself in, and ties the two Keys (for there is a double Door to the Room) about her Wrist, when she goes to Bed. She talks of the House having been attempted to be broke open two or three times; whether to fright me, I can’t tell; but it makes me fearful; but not so much as I should be, if I had not other and greater Fears.</p>
<p class="indent">I slept but little the preceding Night, and got up, and pretended to sit by the Window, which looks into the spacious Gardens; but I was writing all the time, from Break of Day to her getting up, and after, when she was absent.</p>
<p class="indent">At Breakfast she presented the two Maids to me, the Cook and House-maid, poor awkward Souls, that I can see no Hopes of, they seem so devoted to her and Ignorance. Yet I am resolv’d if possible, to find some way to escape, before this wicked Master comes.</p>
<p class="indent">There are besides, of Servants, the Coachman <em class="calibre6">Robert</em>, a Groom, a Helper, a Footman; all but <em class="calibre6">Robert</em> (and he is accessary to my Ruin) strange Creatures, that promise nothing; and all likewise devoted to this Woman. The Gardener looks like a good honest Man; but he is kept at a Distance; and seems reserv’d.</p>
<p class="indent">I wonder’d I saw not Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> the Clergyman, but would not ask after him, apprehending it might give her some Jealousy; but when I had beheld the rest, he was the only one I had Hopes of; for I thought his Cloth would set him above assisting in my Ruin.—But, in the Afternoon he came; for it seems he has a little <em class="calibre6">Latin</em> School in <a id="page_112"></a>the neighbouring Village, which he attends, and this brings him in a little Matter, additional to my Master’s Favour, till something better falls, of which he has Hopes.</p>
<p class="indent">He is a sensible, sober young Gentleman, and when I saw him, I confirm’d myself in my Hopes of him; for he seem’d to take great Notice of my Distress and Grief; for I could not hide it; tho’ he appear’d fearful of Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, who watch’d all our Motions and Words.</p>
<p class="indent">He has an Apartment in the House; but is mostly at a Lodging in the Town, for Conveniency of his little School; only on <em class="calibre6">Saturday</em> Afternoons and <em class="calibre6">Sundays</em>; and he preaches sometimes for the Parson of the Village, which is about three Miles off.</p>
<p class="indent">I hope to go to Church with him to-morrow: Sure it is not in her Instructions to deny me. He can’t have thought of every thing. And something may strike out for me there.</p>
<p class="indent">I have ask’d her, for a Feint, (because she shan’t think I am so well provided) to indulge me with Pen and Ink, tho’ I have been using my own so freely when her Absence would let me; for I begg’d to be left to myself as much as possible. She says she will let me have it, but then I must promise not to send any Writing out of the House, without her seeing it. I said, It was only to divert my Grief, when I was by myself, as I desired to be; for I lov’d Writing; but I had nobody to send to, she knew well enough.</p>
<p class="indent">No, not at present, may-be, said she; but I am told you are a great Writer, and it is in my Instructions to see all you write; so, look you here, said she, I will let you have a Pen and Ink, and two Sheets of Paper; for this Employment will keep you out of worse Thoughts: but I must see them always when I ask, written or not written. That’s very hard, said I; but may I not have the Closet in the Room where we lie, to myself, with the Key to lock up my Things? I believe I may consent to that, said she, and I will set it in Order for you, and leave the Key in the Door. And there is a Spinnet too, said she; if it be in Tune, you may play to divert you now-and-then; for I know my old Lady learnt you.</p>
<p class="indent">So I resolv’d to hide a Pen of my own here, and another there, for fear I should come to be deny’d, and a little of my Ink in a broken China Cup, and a little in another Cup; and a Sheet of Paper here-and-there among my Linen, with a little Wax and a few Wafers in several Places, lest I should be search’d; and something I thought <a id="page_113"></a>might happen to open a Way for my Deliverance, by these or some other Means. O the Pride, thought I, I shall have, if I can secure my Innocence, and escape the artful Wiles of this wicked Master! For, if he comes hither, I am undone to be sure! For this naughty Woman will assist him, rather than fail, in the worst of his Attempts, and he’ll have no Occasion to send her out of the Way, as he would have done Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em> once. So I must set all my little Wits at Work!</p>
<p class="indent">It is a Grief to me to write, and not to be able to send to you what I write; but now it is all the Diversion I have, and if God will favour my Escape with my Innocence, as I trust he graciously will, for all these black Prospects, with what Pleasure shall I read them afterwards!</p>
<p class="indent">I was going to say, Pray for your dutiful Daughter, as I used; but, alas! you cannot know my Distress! tho’ I am sure I have your Prayers. And I will write on as Things happen, that if a Way should open, my Scribble may be ready to send. For what I do, must be at a Jirk, to be sure.</p>
<p class="indent">O how I want such an obliging honest-hearted Man <em class="calibre6">as John!</em></p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">I am now come to SUNDAY</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">Well, here is a sad Thing! I am deny’d by this barbarous Woman, to go to Church, as I had built upon I might. And she has huffed poor Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> all to pieces, for pleading for me. I find he is to be forbid the House, if she pleases. Poor Gentleman! all his Dependence is upon my Master, who has a very good Living for him, if the Incumbent die, and he has kept his Bed these four Months, of old Age and Dropsy.</p>
<p class="indent">He pays me great Respect; and I see pities me; and would perhaps assist my Escape from these Dangers, but I have nobody to plead for me; and why should I wish to ruin a poor Gentleman, by engaging him against his Interest? Yet one would do any thing to preserve one’s Innocence; and God Almighty would, may-be, make it up to him!</p>
<p class="indent">O judge (but how shall you see what I write!) my distracted Condition, to be reduc’d to such a Pass as to desire to lay Traps for Mankind!—But he wants sadly to say something to me, as he whisperingly hinted.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_114"></a>The Wretch (I think I will always call her the <em class="calibre6">Wretch</em> henceforth) abuses me more and more. I was but talking to one of the Maids just now, indeed a little to tamper with her by degrees; and she popt upon us, and said—Nay, don’t offer, Madam, to tempt poor innocent Country Maidens from doing their Duty. You wanted, I hear, she should take a Walk with you. But I charge you, <em class="calibre6">Nan</em>, never stir with her, nor obey her, without letting me know it, in the smallest Trifles.—I say, walk with you! why, where would you go, I trow? Why, barbarous Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, said I, only to look a little up the Elm-walk, as you would not let me go to Church.</p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre6">Nan</em>, said she, to shew me how much they were all in her Power, pull off Madam’s Shoes, and bring them to me. I have taken care of her others—Indeed she shan’t, said I—Nay, said <em class="calibre6">Nan</em>, but I must, if my Mistress bids me; so pray, Madam, don’t hinder me: And so indeed, (would you believe it?) she took my Shoes off, and left me barefoot: And, for my Share, I have been so frighten’d at this, that I have not Power even to relieve my Mind by my Tears. I am quite stupify’d, to be sure! Here I was forc’d to leave off.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">Now I will give you a Picture of this Wretch! She is a broad, squat, pursy, fat Thing, quite ugly, if any thing God made can be ugly; about forty Years old. She has a huge Hand, and an Arm as thick as my Waist, I believe. Her Nose is flat and crooked, and her Brows grow over her Eyes; a dead, spiteful, grey, goggling Eye, to be sure, she has. And her Face is flat and broad; and as to Colour, looks like as if it had been pickled a Month in Saltpetre: I dare say she drinks!—She has a hoarse man-like Voice, and is as thick as she’s long; and yet looks so deadly strong, that I am afraid she would dash me at her Foot in an Instant, if I was to vex her.—So that with a Heart more ugly than her Face, she frightens me sadly; and I am undone, to be sure, if God does not protect me; for she is very, very wicked—indeed she is.</p>
<p class="indent">This is but poor helpless Spight in me!—But the Picture is too near the Truth notwithstanding. She sends me a Message just now, that I shall have my Shoes again, if I will accept of her Company to walk with me in the Garden—To <em class="calibre6">waddle</em> with me, rather, thought I.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, ’tis not my Business to quarrel with her downright. I shall be watch’d the narrower, if I do; and so I will go with the hated <a id="page_115"></a>Wretch.—O for my dear Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis!</em> or rather, to be safe with my dear Father and Mother!</p>
<p class="blockquote1">Oh I’m out of my Wits, for Joy! Just as I have got my Shoes on, I am told, <em class="calibre6">John</em>, honest <em class="calibre6">John</em>, is come, on Horseback!—God bless him! What Joy is this! But I’ll tell you more by-and-by. I must not let her know, I am so glad to see this dear blessed <em class="calibre6">John</em>, to be sure!—O but he looks sad, as I see him out of the Window! What can be the Matter!—I hope my dear Parents are well, and Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>, and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>, and every body, my naughty Master not excepted—for I wish him to live and repent of all his Wickedness to poor me.</p>
<p class="indent">O dear Heart! what a World do we live in!—I am now to take up my Pen again! But I am in a sad Taking truly! Another puzzling Tryal, to be sure!</p>
<p class="indent">Here is <em class="calibre6">John</em>, as I said; and the poor Man came to me, with Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, who whisper’d, that I would say nothing about the Shoes, for my own sake, as she said. The poor Man saw my Distress, and my red Eyes, and my haggard Looks, I suppose; for I had had a sad Time of it, you must needs think; and he would have hid it, but his Eyes run over. Oh Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Pamela!</em> said he; Oh Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Pamela!</em>—Well, honest Fellow-servant, said I, I cannot help it at present! I am oblig’d to your Honesty and Kindness, to be sure; and then he wept more. Said I, (for my Heart was ready to break to see his Grief; for it is a touching thing to see a Man cry) Tell me the worst! Is my Master coming? No, no, said he, and sobb’d.—Well, said I, is there any News of my poor Father and Mother? how do they do?—I hope, well, said he; I know nothing to the contrary: There is no Mishap, I hope, to Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>, or Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>, or my Fellow-servants! No—said he, poor Man! with a long N—o, as if his Heart would burst. Well, thank God then! said I.</p>
<p class="indent">The Man’s a Fool, said Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, I think; what ado is here! why sure thou’rt in Love, <em class="calibre6">John</em>. Dost thou not see young Madam is well? what ails thee, Man? Nothing at all, said he, but I am such a Fool, as to cry for Joy to see good Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>: But I have a Letter for you.</p>
<p class="indent">I took it, and saw it was from my Master; so I put it in my Pocket. Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, said I, you need not, I hope, see this. No, no, said she, I see who it comes from, well enough; or else, may-be, I must desire to see it.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>And here is one for you, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, said he; but yours, said he to me, requires an Answer, which I must carry back early in the Morning, or to-night, if I can.</p>
<p class="indent">You have no more, <em class="calibre6">John</em>, said Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, for Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, have you? No, said he, I have not. But every body’s kind Love and Service. Ay, to us both, to be sure, said she. <em class="calibre6">John</em>, said I, I will read the Letter, and pray take care of yourself; for you are a good Man. God bless you; and I rejoice to see you, and hear from you all. But I long’d to say more, only that nasty Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>—</p>
<p class="indent">So I came up hither, and lock’d myself in my Closet, and open’d the Letter; and this is a Copy of it.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">‘<em class="calibre6">My dearest</em> P<small class="calibre2">AMELA</small>,</p>
<p class="noindent">‘I Send purposely to you on an Affair that concerns you very much, and me something, but chiefly for your sake. I am conscious that I have proceeded by you in such a manner as may justly alarm your Fears, and give Concern to your honest Friends: And all my Pleasure is, that I can and will make you Amends for all the Disturbance I have given you. As I promis’d, I sent to your Father the Day after your Departure, that he might not be too much concern’d for you, and assured him of my Honour to you; and made an Excuse, such a one as ought to have satisfy’d him, for your not coming to him. But this was not sufficient, it seems; for he, poor Man! came to me next Morning, and set my Family almost in an Uproar about you.</p>
<p class="indent">‘O my dear Girl, what Trouble has not your Obstinacy given me, and yourself too! I had no way to pacify him, but to promise, that he should see a Letter wrote from you to Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>, to satisfy him you were well.</p>
<p class="indent">‘Now all my Care in this Case, is for your aged Parents, lest they should be fatally touched with Grief; and for you, whose Duty and Affection for them I know to be so strong and laudable: For this Reason I beg you will write a few Lines to them, and let me prescribe the Form for it; which I have done, putting myself as near as I can in your Place, and expressing your Sense, with a Warmth that I doubt will have too much possess’d you.</p>
<p class="indent">‘After what is done, and which cannot now be help’d, but which, I assure you, shall turn out honourably for you, I expect not to be refus’d; because I cannot possibly have any View in it, but to satisfy your Parents; which is more your Concern than mine; and so I must <a id="page_117"></a>beg you will not alter one Tittle of the underneath. If you do, it will be impossible for me to send it, or that it should answer the good End I propose by it.</p>
<p class="indent">‘I have promis’d to you, that I will not approach you without your Leave: If I find you easy, and not attempting to dispute or avoid your present Lot, I will keep to my Word, tho’ ’tis a Difficulty upon me. Nor shall the present Restraint upon you last long: For I will assure you, that I am resolv’d very soon to convince you, how ardently I am</p>
<p class="right">‘<em class="calibre6">Yours</em>, &amp;c.’</p>
<p class="indent">The Letter he prescribed for me was this:<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">‘<em class="calibre6">Dear Mrs</em>. J<small class="calibre2">ERVIS</small>,</p>
<p class="noindent">‘I Have, instead of being driven, by <em class="calibre6">Robin</em>, to my dear Father’s, been carry’d off, to where I have no Liberty to tell. However, at present, I am not us’d hardly; and I write to beg you to let my dear Father and Mother, whose Hearts must be well-nigh broken, know, that I am well; and that I am, and, by the Grace of God, ever will be, their dutiful and honest Daughter, as well as</p>
<p class="right">‘<em class="calibre6">Your obliged Friend</em>.</p>
<p class="hangingpara">‘I must neither send Date nor Place; but have most solemn Assurances of honourable Usage.’<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">I knew not what to do on this most strange Request and Occasion. But my Heart bled so much for you, my dear Father, who had taken the Pains to go yourself and inquire after your poor Daughter, as well as for my dear Mother, that I resolv’d to write, and pretty much in the above<a href="part0090.html#ch01_fn-1" class="nounder" id="ch01_fn_1"><sup class="calibre11">1</sup></a> Form, that it might be sent to pacify you, till I could let you, some how or other, know the true State of the Matter. And I wrote this to this strange wicked Master himself:<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">‘S<small class="calibre2">IR</small>,</p>
<p class="noindent">‘IF you knew but the Anguish of my Mind, and how much I suffer by your dreadfully strange Usage of me, you would surely pity me, and consent to my Deliverance. What have I done, that I should be the only Mark of your Cruelty! I can possibly have no Hope, no Desire of living left me, because I cannot have the least Dependence, after what has pass’d, upon your solemn Assurances—It is impossible, <a id="page_118"></a>surely, they should be consistent with the honourable Designs you profess.</p>
<p class="indent">‘Nothing but your Promise of not seeing me here in my deplorable Bondage, can give me the least Ray of Hope.</p>
<p class="indent">‘Don’t drive the poor distressed <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> upon a Rock, I beseech you, that may be the Destruction both of her Body and Soul! You don’t know, Sir, how dreadfully I <em class="calibre6">dare</em>, weak as I am of Mind and Intellect, when my Virtue is in Danger. And, oh! hasten my Deliverance, that a poor unworthy Creature, below the Notice of so great a Man, may not be made the Sport of a high Condition, for no Reason in the World, but because she is not able to defend herself, nor has a Friend that can right her.</p>
<p class="indent">‘I have, Sir, in part to shew my Obedience to you, but indeed, I own, more to give Ease to the Minds of my poor distressed Parents, whose Poverty, one would think, should screen them from Violences of this sort, as well as their poor Daughter, follow’d pretty much the Form you have prescrib’d for me, to Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>; and the Alterations I have made, (for I could not help a few) are of such a Nature, as, tho’ they shew my Concern a little, yet must answer the End you are pleas’d to say you propose by this Letter.</p>
<p class="indent">‘For God’s sake, good Sir, pity my lowly Condition, and my present great Misery; and let me join with all the rest of your Servants to bless that Goodness, which you have extended to every one, but the poor afflicted, heart-broken</p>
<p class="right">‘P<small class="calibre2">AMELA</small>.’</p>
<p class="indent">I thought, when I had written this Letter, and that which he had prescrib’d, it would look like placing a Confidence in Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, to shew them to her; and I shew’d her at the same time my Master’s Letter to me; for I believ’d, the Value he express’d for me, would give me Credit with one who profess’d in every thing to serve him right or wrong; tho’ I had so little Reason, I fear, to pride myself in it: And I was not mistaken; for it has seem’d to influence her not a little, and she is at present mighty obliging, and runs over in my Praises; but is the less to be minded, because she praises as much the Author of all my Miseries, and his honourable Intentions, as she calls them; when I see, that she is capable of thinking, as I fear <em class="calibre6">he</em> does, that every thing that makes for his wicked Will, is honourable, tho’ to the Ruin of the Innocent. Pray God I may find it otherwise. I hope, <a id="page_119"></a>whatever the naughty Gentleman may intend, that I shall be at least rid of her impertinent bold Way of Talk, when she seems to think, by his Letter, that he means honourably.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">I am now come to MONDAY, the 5th Day of my Bondage and Misery</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">I Was in Hope to have an Opportunity to see <em class="calibre6">John</em>, and have a little private Talk with him before he went away; but it could not be. The poor Man’s excessive Sorrow made Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> take it into her Head, to think he lov’d me, and so she brought up a Message to me from him this Morning, that he was going. I desir’d he might come up to my Closet, as I call’d it; and she came with him: And the honest Man, as I thought him, was as full of Concern as before, at taking Leave. And I gave him my two Letters, the one for Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>, inclos’d in that for my Master: But Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> would see me seal them up, for fear of any other—I was surpriz’d, at the Man’s going away, to see him drop a Bit of Paper, just at the Head of the Stairs, which I took up without Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>’s seeing me; but I was a thousand times more surpriz’d, when I return’d to my Closet, and opening it, read as follows:<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">‘<em class="calibre6">Good Mrs</em>. P<small class="calibre2">AMELA</small>,</p>
<p class="noindent">‘I Am griev’d to tell you how much you have been deceiv’d and betray’d, and that by such a vile Dog as I. Little did I think it would come to this. But I must say, if ever there was a Rogue in the World, it is me. I have all along shew’d your Letters to my Master: He employ’d me for that Purpose; and he saw every one before your Father and Mother, and then seal’d them up, and sent me with them. I had some Business that way; but not half so often as I pretended. And as soon as I heard how it was with you, I was ready to hang myself. You may well think I could not stand in your Presence. O vile, vile Wretch, to bring you to this! If you are ruin’d, I am the Rogue that caus’d it. All the Justice I can do you, is, to tell you, you are in vile Hands; and I am afraid will be undone in spite of all your sweet Innocence; and I believe I shall never live after I know it. If you can forgive me, you are exceeding good; but I shall never forgive myself, that’s certain. Howsomever, it will do you no good to make this known; and may-hap I may live to do you Service. If I can, I will. I am sure I ought—Master kept your last two or three Letters, and <a id="page_120"></a>did not send them at all. I am the most abandon’d Wretch of Wretches.</p>
<p class="right">‘J. A<small class="calibre2">RNOLD</small>.</p>
<p class="hangingpara">‘You see your Undoing has been long hatching. Pray take care of your sweet Self. Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> is a Devil. But in my Master’s t‘other House you have not one false Heart, but myself. Out upon me for a Villain!’</p>
<p class="indent">My dear Father and Mother, when you come to this Place, I make no doubt your Hair will stand an End, as mine does!—O the Deceitfulness of the Heart of Man!—This <em class="calibre6">John</em>, that I took to be the honestest of Men; that you took for the same; that was always praising you to me, and me to you, and for nothing so much as for our honest Hearts; this very Fellow was all the while a vile Hypocrite, and a perfidious Wretch, and helping to carry on my Ruin!</p>
<p class="indent">But he says enough of himself; and I can only sit down with this sad Reflection, That Power and Riches never want Tools to promote their vilest Ends, and that there is nothing so hard to be known as the Heart of Man!—Yet I can but pity the poor Wretch, since he seems to have some Remorse, and I believe it best to keep his Wickedness secret; and, if it lies in my way, to encourage his Penitence; for I may possibly make some Discoveries by it.</p>
<p class="indent">One thing I should mention in this Place; he brought down, in a Portmanteau, all the Cloaths and Things my Lady and Master had presented me, and moreover two Velvet Hoods, and a Velvet Scarf, that used to be worn by my Lady; but I have no Comfort in them!</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> had the Portmanteau brought into my Closet, and she shew’d me what was in it; but then locked it up, and said, she would let me have what I would out of it, when I asked; but if I had the Key, it might set me a wanting to go abroad, may-be; and so the insolent Woman put it in her Pocket.</p>
<p class="indent">I gave myself over to sad Reflections upon this strange and surprizing Discovery <em class="calibre6">of John</em>’s, and wept much for him, and for myself too; for now I see, as he says, my Ruin has been so long a hatching, that I can make no Doubt what my Master’s honourable Professions will end in. What a Heap of Names does the poor Fellow call himself! But what must they deserve, who set him to work? O what has this wicked Master to answer for, to be so corrupt himself, and to corrupt others, who would have been innocent; and all to carry on <a id="page_121"></a>further a more corrupt Scene, and to ruin a poor Creature, who never did him Harm, nor wish’d him any; and who can still pray for his Happiness, and his Repentance?</p>
<p class="indent">I can but wonder what these Gentlemen, as they are called, can think of themselves for these vile Doings? <em class="calibre6">John</em> had some Inducement; for he hoped to please his Master, who rewarded him, and was bountiful to him; and the same may be said, bad as she is, for this same odious Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>. But what Inducement has my Master for taking so much Pains to do the Devil’s Work?—If he loves me, as ’tis falsely called, must he therefore ruin me, and lay Traps for me, and endeavour to make me as bad as himself? I cannot imagine what good the Undoing of such a poor Creature as I can procure him!—To be sure, I am a very worthless Body. People indeed say I am handsome; but if I was so, should not a Gentleman prefer an honest Servant to a guilty Harlot?—And must he be <em class="calibre6">more</em> earnest to seduce me, because I dread of all things to be seduced, and would rather lose my Life than my Honesty!</p>
<p class="indent">Well, these are strange things to me! I cannot account for them, for my Share; but sure nobody will say, that these fine Gentlemen have any Tempter but their own wicked Wills!—This naughty Master could run away from me, when he thought none but his Servants should know his base Attempts, in that sad Closet Affair; but is it not strange, that he should not be afraid of the All-seeing Eye, from which even that black poisonous Heart of his, and its most secret Motions, could not be hid?—But what avail me these sorrowful Reflections? He is and will be wicked; and I am, I fear, to be a Victim to his lawless Attempts, if the God in whom I trust, and to whom I hourly pray, prevent it not!</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">TUESDAY</em> and <em class="calibre6">WEDNESDAY</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">I Have been hinder’d, by this wicked Woman’s watching me too close, from writing on <em class="calibre6">Tuesday</em>; and so I will put both these Days together. I have been a little Turn with her, for an Airing, in the Chariot, and walked several times in the Garden; but have always her at my Heels.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> came to see us, and took a Walk with us once; and while her Back was just turn’d, (encourag’d by the Hint he had before given me) I said, Sir, I see two Tiles upon that Parsley-bed; <a id="page_122"></a>cannot one cover them with Mould, with a Note between them, on Occasion?—A good Hint, said he; let that Sun-flower by the Backdoor of the Garden be the Place; I have a Key to that; for it is my nearest way to the Town.</p>
<p class="indent">So I was forced to begin. O what Inventions will Necessity be the Parent of! I hugg’d myself with the Thought; and she coming to us, he said, as if he was continuing the Discourse we were in; No, not extraordinary pleasant. What’s that? what’s that? said Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>—Only, said he, the Town, I’m saying, is not very pleasant. No, indeed, said she, ’tis not; ’tis a poor Town, to my thinking. Are there any Gentry in it? said I. And so we chatted on about the Town, to deceive her. But my Deceit intended no Hurt to any body.</p>
<p class="indent">We then talked of the Garden, how large and pleasant, and the like; and sat down on the turfted Slope of the fine Fish-pond, to see the Fishes play upon the Surface of the Water; and she said, I should angle if I would.</p>
<p class="indent">I wish, said I, you’d be so kind to fetch me a Rod and Baits. Pretty Mistress! said she—I know better than that, I’ll assure you! at this time!—I mean no Harm, said I, indeed. Let me tell you, said she, I know nobody has their Thoughts more about them than you. A body ought to look to it, where you are. But we’ll angle a little to-morrow. Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, who is much afraid of her, turn’d the Discourse to a general Subject. I saunter’d in, and left them to talk by themselves; but he went away to Town, and she was soon after me.</p>
<p class="indent">I had got to my Pen and Ink; and I said, I want some Paper (putting what I was about in my Bosom): You know I have wrote two Letters, and sent them by <em class="calibre6">John</em> (O how his Name, poor guilty Fellow! grieves me). Well, said she, you have some left; one Sheet did for those two Letters. Yes, said I, but I used half another for a Wrapper, you know; and see how I scribbled the other Half; and so I shewd her a Parcel of broken Scraps of Verses, which I had try’d to recollect, and which I had wrote purposely that she might see, and think me usually employ’d to such idle Purposes. Ay, said she, so you have; well, I‘ll give you two Sheets more; but let me see how you dispose of them, either written or blank. Well, thinks I, I hope still, <em class="calibre6">Argus</em>, to be too hard for thee. Now <em class="calibre6">Argus</em>,<a id="exp-note_24"></a><a href="part0021_split_024.html#exp-note-24" class="nounder">*</a> the Poets say, had an hundred Eyes, and was made to watch with them all, as she is.</p>
<p class="indent">She brought me the Paper, and said, Now, Madam, let me see you write something. I will, said I; and took the Pen, and wrote, ‘I wish <a id="page_123"></a>Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> would be as good to me, as I would be to her, if I had it in my Power!’—That’s pretty now! said she; well, I hope I am; but what then? ‘Why then (<em class="calibre6">wrote I</em>) she would do me the Favour to let me know, what I have done to be made her Prisoner; and what she thinks is to become of me.’ Well, and what then, said she? ‘Why then, of Consequence, (<em class="calibre6">scribbled I</em>) she would let me see her Instructions, that I may know how far to blame her, or acquit her.’</p>
<p class="indent">Thus I fooled on, to shew her my Fondness for scribbling; for I had no Expectation of any Good from her; that so she might suppose I employ’d myself, as I said, to no better Purpose at other times: For she will have it, that I am upon some Plot, I am so silent, and love so much to be by myself.—She would have had me go on a little further. No, said I, you have not answer’d me. Why, said she, what can you doubt, when my Master himself assures you of his Honour? Ay, says I; but lay your Hand to your Heart, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, and tell me, if you yourself believe him. Yes, said she, to be sure I do. But, said I, what do you call Honour?—Why, said she, what does he call Honour, think you?—Ruin! Shame! Disgrace! said I, I fear!—Pho, pho, said she; if you have any Doubt about it, he can best explain his own Meaning!—I’ll send him word to come to satisfy you, if you will!—Horrid Creature! said I, all in a Fright!—Can’st thou not stab me to the Heart? I’d rather thou wouldst, than say such another Word!—But I hope there is no Thought of his coming.</p>
<p class="indent">She had the Wickedness to say, No, no; he don’t intend to come, as I know of—But if I was he, I would not be long away!—What means the Woman, said I?—Means! said she (turning it off); why I mean, I would come, if I was he, and put an End to all your Fears—by making you as happy as you wish. ’Tis out of his Power, said I, to make me happy, great and rich as he is, but by leaving me innocent, and giving me Liberty to go to my dear Father and Mother.</p>
<p class="indent">She went away soon after, and I ended my Letter, in Hopes to have an Opportunity to lay it in the appointed Place. So I went to her, and said; I suppose, as it is not dark, I may take another Turn in the Garden. ’Tis too late, said she; but if you will go, don’t stay, and, <em class="calibre6">Nan</em>, see and attend Madam, as she called me.</p>
<p class="indent">So I went towards the Pond, the Wench following me, and dropt purposely my Hussy: And when I came near the Tiles, I said, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Ann</em>, I have dropt my Hussy; be so kind to look for it. I had it by the Pond-side. The Wench went to look, and I slipt the Note between <a id="page_124"></a>the Tiles, and cover’d them as quick as I could with the light Mould, quite unperceiv’d; and the Maid finding the Hussy, I took it, and saunter’d in again, and met Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> coming to see after me. What I wrote was this:<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">‘<em class="calibre6">Reverend Sir</em>,</p>
<p class="noindent">‘THE want of Opportunity to speak my Mind to you, I am sure will excuse this Boldness in a poor Creature that is betray’d hither, I have Reason to think, for the worst Purposes. You know something, to be sure, of my Story, my native Poverty, which I am not ashamed of, my late Lady’s Goodness, and my Master’s Designs upon me. ’Tis true, he promises Honour, and all that; but the Honour of the Wicked is Disgrace and Shame to the Virtuous. And he may think he may keep his Promises according to the Notions he may allow himself to hold; and yet, according to mine, and every good Body’s beside, quite ruin me.</p>
<p class="indent">‘I am so wretched, and ill treated by this Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, and she is so ill-principled a Woman, that as I may soon want the Opportunity which the happy Hint of this Day affords to my Hopes; so I throw myself at once upon your Goodness, without the least Reserve; for I cannot be worse than I am, should <em class="calibre6">that</em> fail me; which, I dare say, to your Power, it will not: For I see it, Sir, in your Looks, I hope it from your Cloth, and I doubt it not from your Inclination, in a Case circumstanced as my unhappy one is. For, Sir, in helping me out of my present Distress, you perform all the Acts of Religion in one; and the highest Mercy and Charity, both to a Body and a Soul of a poor Wretch, that, believe me, Sir, has, at present, not so much as in Thought, swerv’d from her Innocence.</p>
<p class="indent">‘Is there not some way to be found out for my Escape, without Danger to yourself? Is there no Gentleman or Lady of Virtue in this Neighbourhood, to whom I may fly, only till I can find a way to get to my poor Father and Mother? Cannot Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> be made acquainted with my sad Story, by your conveying a Letter to her? My poor Parents are so low in the World, they can do nothing but break their Hearts for me; and that, I fear, will be the End of it.</p>
<p class="indent">‘My Master promises, if I will be easy, as he calls it, in my present Lot, he will not come down without my Consent. Alas! Sir, this is nothing. For what’s the Promise of a Person, who thinks himself at Liberty to act as he has done by me? If he comes, it must be to ruin <a id="page_125"></a>me; and come, to be sure, he will, when he thinks he has silenc’d the Clamours of my Friends, and lulled me, as no doubt he hopes, into a fatal Security.</p>
<p class="indent">‘Now, therefore, Sir, is all the Time I have to work and struggle for the Preservation of my Honesty. If I stay till he comes, I am undone. You have a Key to the back Garden-door; I have great Hopes from that. Study, good Sir, and contrive for me. I will faithfully keep your Secret.—Yet I should be loth to have you injur’d for me!</p>
<p class="indent">‘I say no more, but commit this to the happy Tiles, and to the Bosom of that Earth from which I hope my Deliverance will take Root, and bring forth such Fruit, as may turn to my inexpressible Joy, and your eternal Reward, both here and hereafter. As shall ever pray,</p>
<p class="right">‘<em class="calibre6">Your most oppressed humble Servant</em>.’</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">THURSDAY</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">THIS completes a fatal Week since my setting out, as I hoped, to see you, my dear Father and Mother. O how different my Hopes then, from what they are now! Yet who knows what these happy Tiles may produce!</p>
<p class="indent">But I must tell you, first, how I have been beaten by Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes!</em> ’Tis very true!</p>
<p class="indent">My Impatience was great to walk in the Garden, to see if any thing had offer’d, answerable to my Hopes. But this wicked Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> would not let me go without her; and she said she was not at Leisure. We had a great many Words about it; for I said, it was very hard I could not be trusted to walk by myself in the Garden for a little Air; but must be dogg’d and watch’d worse than a Thief.</p>
<p class="indent">She still pleaded her Instructions, and said she was not to trust me out of her Sight: And you had better, said she, be easy and contented, I assure you. For I have worse Orders than you have yet found; and if you remember, said she, what you said when Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> was with us, asking if there were any Gentry in the Neighbourhood, it makes me suspect you want to get away to them, to tell your sad dismal Story, as you call it.</p>
<p class="indent">My Heart was at my Mouth; for I fear’d by that Hint, she had seen my Letter under the Tiles: O how uneasy I was! At last she said, Well, since you take on so, you may take a Turn, and I will be with you in a Minute.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_126"></a>I went out; and when I was out of the Sight of her Window, I speeded towards the hopeful Place; but was soon forced to slacken my Pace, by her odious Voice; Hey-day, why so nimble, and so fast? said she: What! are you upon a Wager? I stopt for her, till her pursy Sides were waddled up to me; and she held by my Arm, half out of Breath: So I was forced to pass by the dear Place, without daring to look at it.</p>
<p class="indent">The Gardener was at work a little further, and so we looked upon him, and I began to talk about his Art; but she said softly, My Instructions are, not to let you be so familiar with the Servants. Why, said I, are you afraid I should confederate with them to commit a Robbery upon my Master? May-be I am, said the odious Wretch; for to rob him of yourself, would be the worst that could happen to him, in his Opinion.</p>
<p class="indent">And pray, said I, walking on, how came I to be his Property? What Right has he in me,<a id="exp-note_25"></a><a href="part0021_split_025.html#exp-note-25" class="nounder">*</a> but such as a Thief may plead to stolen Goods?—Why, was ever the like heard, says she!—This is downright Rebellion, I protest! Well, well, Lambkin, (which the Foolish often calls me) if I was in his Place, he should not have his Property in you long questionable. Why, what would you do, said I, if you was he?—Not stand shill-I, shall-I, as he does; but put you and himself both out of your Pain.—Why, <em class="calibre6">Jezebel</em>,<a id="exp-note_26"></a><a href="part0021_split_026.html#exp-note-26" class="nounder">*</a> said I, (I could not help it); would you ruin me by Force?—Upon this she gave me a deadly Slap upon my Shoulder: Take that, said she; who do you call <em class="calibre6">Jezebel?</em></p>
<p class="indent">I was so scar’d, (for you never beat me, my dear Father and Mother, in your Lives) that I was as one thunder-struck; and looked round, as if I wanted somebody to help me; but, alas! I had nobody; and said, at last, rubbing my Shoulder, Is this too in your Instructions?—Alas! for me! am I to be beaten too? and so I fell a crying, and threw myself upon the Grass-walk we were upon.—Said she, in a great Pet, I won’t be call’d such Names, I’ll assure you. Marry come up! I see you have a Spirit! You must and shall be kept under. I’ll manage such little provoking Things as you, I warrant ye! Come, come, we’ll go in Doors, and I’ll lock you up, and you shall have no Shoes, nor any thing else, if this is to be the Case!</p>
<p class="indent">I didn’t know what to do. This was a cruel thing to me, and I blam’d myself for my free Speech; for now I had given her some Pretence; and Oh! thinks I, here I have, by my Malapertness, ruin’d the only Project I had left.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_127"></a>The Gardener saw this Scene; but she called to him, Well, <em class="calibre6">Jacob</em>, what do you stare at! Pray mind what you’re upon. And away he walk’d, to another Quarter, out of Sight.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, thinks I, I must put on the Dissembler a little, I see. She took my Hand roughly; Come, get up, said she, and come in Doors.—I’ll <em class="calibre6">Jezebel</em> you, I warrant ye!—Why, dear Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, said I—None of your Dears and your Coaxing, said she; why not <em class="calibre6">Jezebel</em> again!—She was in a fearful Passion, I saw, and I was half out of my Wits. Thinks I, I have often heard Women blam’d for their Tongues; I wish mine had been shorter. But I can’t go in, said I, indeed I can’t!—Why, said she, can’t you? I‘ll warrant I can take such a thin Body as you are under my Arm, and carry you in, if you won’t walk. You don’t know my Strength—Yes, but I do, said I, too well; and will you not use me worse when I come in?—So I arose, and she mutter’d to herself all the way, She to be a <em class="calibre6">Jezebel</em> with me, that had used me so well! and such-like.</p>
<p class="indent">When I came near the House, I said, sitting down upon a Settle-bench, Well, I will not go in, till you say, you will forgive me, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jemkes</em>—If you will forgive my calling you that Name, I will forgive your beating me—She sat down by me, and seem’d in a great Pucker, and said, Well, come, I will forgive you for this time; and so kissed me, as a Mark of Reconciliation—But pray, said I, tell me where I am to walk, and go, and give me what Liberty you can; and when I know the most you can favour me with, you shall see I will be as content as I can; and not ask you for more.</p>
<p class="indent">Why, said she, that’s something like: I wish I could give you all the Liberty you desire; for you must think it is no Pleasure to me to tie you to my Petticoat, as it were, and not to let you stir without me—But People that will do their Duties, must have some Trouble; and what I do, is to serve as good a Master, to be sure, as lives—Ay, says I, to every body but me!—He loves you too well, to be sure, said she, and that’s the Reason; so you ought to bear it. I say, <em class="calibre6">love</em>, said I! Come, said she, don’t let the Wench see you have been crying, nor tell her any Tales; for you won’t tell them fairly, I am sure; and I’ll send her, and you shall take another Walk in the Garden, if you will. May-be, said she, it will get you a Stomach to your Dinner; for you don’t eat enough to keep Life and Soul together. You are Beauty to the Bone, said the strange Wretch, or you could not look so well as you do, with so little Stomach, so little Rest, and so much pining and <a id="page_128"></a>whining for nothing at all. Well, thought I, say what thou wilt, so I can be rid of thy bad Tongue and Company: And I hop’d to find some Opportunity now, to come at my Sun-flower. But I walked the other way, to take that in my Return, to avoid Suspicion.</p>
<p class="indent">I forced my Discourse to the Wench; but it was all upon general things; for I find she is asked after every thing I say and do. When I came near the Place, as I had been devising, I said, Pray, step to the Gardener, and ask him to gather a Sallad for me to Dinner. She called out, <em class="calibre6">Jacob!</em>—Said I, he can’t hear you so far off; and pray tell him, I should like a Cucumber too, if he has one. When she had stept about a Bow-shot from me, I popt down, and whipt my Fingers under the upper Tile, and pulled out a little Letter, without Direction, and thrust it in my Bosom, trembling for Joy. She was with me before I could well secure it; and I was in such a taking, that I feared I should discover myself. You seem frighted, Madam, said she: Why, said I, with a lucky Thought, (alas! your poor Daughter will make an Intriguer by-and-by; but I hope an innocent one!) I stoopt to smell at the Sun-flower, and a great nasty Worm run into the Ground, that startled me; for I don’t love Worms. Said she, Sun-flowers don’t smell. So I find, said I. And so we walked in; and Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> said, Well, you have made haste in—You shall go another time.</p>
<p class="indent">I went up to my Closet, lock’d myself in, and opening my Letter, found in it these Words:<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="noindent">‘I Am infinitely concern’d for your Distress. I most heartily wish it may be in my Power to serve and save so much Innocence, Beauty and Merit. My whole Dependence is upon the ’Squire; and I have a near View of being provided for by his Goodness to me. But yet, I would sooner forfeit all my Hopes upon him, and trust in God for the rest, than not assist you, if possible. I never look’d upon Mr. <em class="calibre6">B</em>. in the Light he now appears to me in, in your Case. To be sure, he is no profess’d Deboshee. But I am intirely of Opinion, you should, if possible, get out of his Hands, and especially as you are in very bad ones in Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>’s.</p>
<p class="indent">‘We have here the Widow Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em>, Mistress of a good Fortune, and a Woman of Virtue, I believe. We have also old Sir <em class="calibre6">Simon Darnford</em>, and his Lady, who is a good Woman; and they have two Daughters. All the rest are but middling People, and Traders, at best. I will try, if you please, either Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em>, or Lady <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em>, if they <a id="page_129"></a>will permit you to take Refuge with them. I see no Probability of keeping myself conceal’d in this Matter; but will, as I said, risque all things to serve you; for I never saw a Sweetness and Innocence like yours; and your hard Case has attached me intirely to you; for I know, as you so happily express, if I can serve you in this Case, I shall thereby perform all the Acts of Religion in one.</p>
<p class="indent">‘As to Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>, I will convey a Letter, if you please, to her; but it must not be from our Post-house, I give you Caution; for the Man owes all his Bread to the ’Squire, and his Place too; and I believe, by something that dropt from him, over a Can of Ale, has his Instructions. You don’t know how you are surrounded; all which confirms me in your Opinion, that no Honour is meant you, let what will be professed; and I am glad you want no Caution on that Head.</p>
<p class="indent">‘Give me Leave to say, that I had heard much in your Praise, both as to Person and Mind; but I think greatly short of what you deserve: My Eyes convince me of the one, your Letter of the other. For fear of losing the present lucky Opportunity, I am longer than otherwise I should be. But I will not inlarge, only to assure you, that I am, to the best of my Power,</p>
<p class="right">‘<em class="calibre6">Your faithful Friend and Servant</em>,<br class="calibre3"/>‘A<small class="calibre2">RTHUR</small> W<small class="calibre2">ILLIAMS</small>.</p>
<p class="hangingpara">‘I will come once every Morning, and once every Evening, after School-time, to look for your Letters. I’ll come in, and return without going into the House, if I see the Coast clear: Otherwise, to avoid Suspicion, I’ll come in.’<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">I instantly, to this pleasing Letter, wrote as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">‘<em class="calibre6">Reverend Sir</em>,</p>
<p class="noindent">‘O How answerable to your Function, and your Character, is your kind Letter! God bless you for it. I now think I am beginning to be happy. I should be sorry you should suffer on my Account; but I hope it will be made up to you an hundred-fold, by that God whom you so faithfully serve. I should be too happy, could I ever have it in my Power to contribute in the least to it. But, alas! to serve me, must be for God’s sake only; for I am poor and lowly in Fortune; though in Mind, I hope, too high to do a mean or unworthy Deed, to gain a Kingdom. But I lose Time.</p>
<p class="indent">‘Any way you think best, I shall be pleased with; for I know not the <a id="page_130"></a>Persons, nor in what manner it is best to apply to them. I am glad of the Hint you so kindly give me of the Man at the Post-house. I was thinking of opening a way for myself by Letter, when I could have Opportunity; but I see more and more, that I am indeed strangely surrounded with Dangers; and that there is no Dependence to be made on my Master’s Honour.</p>
<p class="indent">‘I should think, Sir, if either of those Ladies would give Leave, I might some way get out by Favour of your Key; and as it is impossible, watched as I am, to know when it can be, suppose, Sir, you could get one made by it, and put it, by the next Opportunity, under the Sun-flower?—I am sure no Time is to be lost; because it is rather my Wonder, that she is not thoughtful about this Key, than otherwise; for she forgets not the minutest thing. But, Sir, if I had this Key, I could, if these Ladies would <em class="calibre6">not</em> shelter me, run away anywhere. And if I was once out of the House, they could have no Pretence to force me in again; for I have done no Harm, and hope to make my Story good to any compassionate Body; and by this way <em class="calibre6">you</em> need not be known. Torture should not wring it from me, I assure you.</p>
<p class="indent">‘One thing more, good Sir. Have you no Correspondence with my Master’s Family? By that means, may-be, I could be informed of his Intentions of coming hither, and when. I inclose you a Letter of a deceitful Wretch; for I can trust you with any thing, poor <em class="calibre6">John Arnold</em>. Its Contents will tell why I inclose it. Perhaps, by his means something may be discover’d; for he seems willing to atone for his Treachery to me, by the Intimation of future Service. I leave the Hint for you to improve upon, and am, Reverend Sir,</p>
<p class="right">‘<em class="calibre6">Your for ever obliged and thankful Servant</em>.</p>
<p class="hangingpara">‘I hope, Sir, by your Favour, I could send a little Packet, now-and-then, some how, to my poor Father and Mother. I have a little Stock of Money, about five or six Guineas: Shall I put half in your Hands, to defray a Man and Horse, or any other Incidents?’<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">I had time but just to transcribe this, before I was called to Dinner; and I put that for Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, with a Wafer in it, in my Bosom, to get an Opportunity to lay it in the dear Place.</p>
<p class="indent">O good Sirs! Of all the Flowers in the Garden, the Sun-flower, sure, is the loveliest!—It is a propitious one to me! How nobly my <a id="page_131"></a>Plot succeeds! But I begin to be afraid my Writings may be discover’d; for they grow large! I stitch them hitherto in my Under-coat, next my Linen. But if this Brute should search me!—I must try to please her, and then she won’t.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">Well, I am but just come off from a Walk in the Garden; and have deposited my Letter by a simple Wile. I got some Horse-beans; and we took a Turn in the Garden, to angle, as Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> had promis’d me. She baited the Hook, and I held it, and soon hooked a lovely Carp. Play it, play it, said she; I did, and brought it to the Bank. A sad Thought just then came into my Head; and I took it, and threw it in again; and O the Pleasure it seem’d to have, to flounce in, when at Liberty!—Why this? says she. O Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes!</em> said I, I was thinking this poor Carp was the unhappy <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>. I was likening you and myself to my naughty Master. As we hooked and deceived the poor Carp, so was I betrayed by false Baits; and when you said, Play it, play it, it went to my Heart, to think I should sport with the Destruction of the poor Fish I had betray’d; and I could not but fling it in again: And did you not see the Joy with which the happy Carp flounced from us! O! said I, may some good merciful Body procure me my Liberty in the same manner; for, to be sure, I think my Danger equal!</p>
<p class="indent">Lord bless thee! said she, what a Thought is there!—Well, said I, I can angle no more. I’ll try <em class="calibre6">my</em> Fortune, said she, and took the Rod. Well, said I, I will plant Life then, if I can, while you are destroying it. I have some Horse-beans here, and I’ll go and stick them into one of the Borders, to see how long they will be coming up; and I will call them my Garden.</p>
<p class="indent">So you see, dear Father and Mother (I hope now you will soon see; for, may-be, if I can’t get away so soon myself, I may send my Papers, some how) I say, you will see, that this furnishes me a good Excuse to look after my Garden another time; and if the Mould should look a little freshish, it won’t be so much suspected. She mistrusted nothing of this; and I went and stuck in here and there my Beans, for about the Length of five Ells, of each side of the Sun-flower; and easily reposited my Letter. And not a little proud am I of this Contrivance. Sure something will do at last. God grant it!</p>
<h4 class="h3"><a id="page_132"></a><em class="calibre6">FRIDAY, SATURDAY</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">I Have just now told you a Trick of mine; now I’ll tell you a Trick of this wicked Woman’s. She comes up to me; says she, I have a Bill I cannot change till to-morrow; and a Tradesman wants his Money most sadly; and I don’t love to turn poor Tradesfolks away without their Money: Have you any about you? How much will do, said I? I have a little! Oh! said she, I want eight Pounds. Alack, said I, I have but between five and six. Lend me that, said she, till to-morrow. I did so; and she went down Stairs: And when she came up, she laugh’d, and said, Well, I have paid the Tradesman: Said I, I hope you’ll give it me again to-morrow. At that, the Assurance, laughing loud, said, Why, what Occasion have you for Money? To tell you the Truth, Lambkin, I didn’t want it. I only fear’d you might make a bad Use of it; and now I can trust <em class="calibre6">Nan</em> with you a little oftener, especially as I have got the Key of your Portmanteau; so that you can neither corrupt her with Money or fine things. Never did any body look more silly than I!—O how I fretted to be so foolishly outwitted!—And the more, as I had hinted to Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, to have some to defray the Charges of my sending to you. I cry’d for Vexation!—And now I have not five Shillings left to support me, if I <em class="calibre6">can</em> get away!—Was ever such a Fool as I! I must be priding myself in my Contrivances indeed! Said I, was this in your Instructions, <em class="calibre6">Wolfkin?</em> for she called me <em class="calibre6">Lambkin</em>. <em class="calibre6">Jezebel</em>, you mean, Child, said she!—Well, I now forgive you heartily; let’s buss, and be Friends!—Out upon you, said I! I cannot bear you. But I durst not call her Names again; for I dread her huge Paw most sadly. The more I think of this thing, the more do I regret it!<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">This Night the Man from the Post-house brought a letter for Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, in which was one inclosed to me: She brought it me up. Said she, Well, my good Master don’t forget us. He has sent you a Letter; and see what he writes to me. So she read, That he hoped her fair Charge was well, happy, and contented: Ay to be sure, said I, I can’t chuse!—That he did not doubt her Care and Kindness to me; that I was very dear to him, and she could not use me too well; and the like. There is a Master for you, said she! Sure you will love and pray for him. I desir’d her to read the rest. No, no, said she, but I won’t. Said I, Are there any Orders for taking my Shoes away, and for beating <a id="page_133"></a>me? No, said she, nor about <em class="calibre6">Jezebel</em> neither. Well, said I, I cry Truce; for I have no mind to be beat again. I thought, said she, we had forgiven one another.</p>
<p class="indent">My Letter is as follows:<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">‘<em class="calibre6">My dearest</em> P<small class="calibre2">AMELA</small>,</p>
<p class="noindent">‘I Begin to repent already, that I have bound myself, by Promise, not to see you till you give me Leave; for I think the Time very tedious. Can you place so much Confidence in me, as to invite me down? Assure yourself that your Generosity shall not be thrown away upon me. I the rather would press this, as I am uneasy for your Uneasiness; for Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> acquaints me that you take your Restraint very heavily; and neither eat, drink, nor rest well; and I have too great an Interest in your Health, not to wish to shorten the Time of this Trial to you; which will be the Consequence of my coming down to you. <em class="calibre6">John</em> too, has intimated to me your Concern, with a Grief that hardly gave him Leave for Utterance; a Grief that a little alarm’d my Tenderness for you. Not that I fear any thing, but that your Disregard to me, which yet my proud Heart will hardly permit me to own, may throw you upon some Rashness, that might encourage a daring Hope: But how poorly do I descend, to be anxious about such a Menial as he?—I will only say one thing, that if you will give me Leave to attend you at the Hall, (consider who it is that requests this from you as a Favour) I solemnly declare, that you shall have Cause to be pleased with this obliging Mark of your Confidence in me, and Consideration for me; and if I find Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> has not behaved to you with the Respect due to one I so dearly love, I will put it intirely into your Power to discharge her the House, if you think proper; and Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>, or who else you please, shall attend you in her place. This I say on a Hint <em class="calibre6">John</em> gave me, as if you resented something from that Quarter. Dearest <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, answer favourably this earnest Request of one that cannot live without you, and on whose Honour to you, you may absolutely depend; and so much the more, as you place a Confidence in it. I am, and assuredly ever will be,</p>
<p class="right">‘<em class="calibre6">Your faithful and affectionate</em>, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="hangingpara">‘You will be glad, I know, to hear your Father and Mother are well, and easy upon your last Letter. That gave me a Pleasure that I <a id="page_134"></a>am resolved you shall not repent. Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> will convey to me your Answer.’<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">I but slightly read this Letter for the present, to give way to one I had hopes of finding by this time, from Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>. I took, in Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>’s Company, an Evening Turn, as I call’d it, and walking by the Place, I said, Do you think Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, any of my Beans can have struck since Yesterday? She laugh’d, and said, You are a poor Gardener; but I love to see you divert yourself. She passing on, I found my good Friend had provided for me, and slipping it in my Bosom, for her Back was towards me, Here, said I, having a Bean in my Hand, is one of them; but it was not stirr’d. No, to be sure, said she; and turn’d upon me a most wicked Jest, unbecoming the Mouth of a Woman, about Planting, <em class="calibre6">&amp;c</em>.<a id="exp-note_27"></a><a href="part0021_split_027.html#exp-note-27" class="nounder">*</a>—When I came in, I hy’d to my Closet, and read as follows:<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="noindent">‘I Am sorry to tell you, that I have a Repulse from Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em>. She is concerned at your Case, she says, but don’t care to make herself Enemies. I apply’d to Lady <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em>, and told her in the most pathetick manner I could, your sad Story, and shew’d her your more pathetick Letter. I found her well dispos’d; but she would advise with Sir <em class="calibre6">Simon</em>, who, by-the-bye, is not a Man of extraordinary Character for Virtue; but he said to his Lady, in my Presence, Why, what is all this, my Dear, but that the ’Squire our Neighbour has a mind to his Mother’s Waiting-maid? And if he takes care she wants for nothing, I don’t see any great Injury will be done her. He hurts no Family by this.’ (So, my dear Father and Mother, it seems that poor Peoples Honesty is to go for nothing). ’And I think, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, you, of all Men, should not engage in this Affair, against your Friend and Patron. He spoke this in so determin’d a manner, that the Lady had done; and I had only to beg no Notice should be taken of the Matter as from me.</p>
<p class="indent">‘I have hinted your Case to Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em>, the Minister of this Parish, but I am concern’d to say, that he imputed selfish Views to me, as if I would make an Interest in your Affections, by my Zeal. And when I represented the Duties of our Function, <em class="calibre6">&amp;c</em>. and protested my Disinterestedness, he coldly said, I was very good; but was a young Man, and knew little of the World. And tho’ ’twas a Thing to be lamented, yet when he and I set about to reform the World in this respect, we should have enough upon our Hands; for, he said, it was too common <a id="page_135"></a>and fashionable a Case to be withstood by a private Clergyman or two: And then he utter’d some Reflections upon the Conduct of the Fathers of the Church, in regard to the first Personages of the Realm,<a id="exp-note_28"></a><a href="part0021_split_028.html#exp-note-28" class="nounder">*</a> as a Justification of his Coldness on this score.</p>
<p class="indent">‘I represented the different Circumstances of your Affair; that other Women liv’d evilly by their own Consent, but to serve you, was to save an Innocence that had but few Examples; and then I shew’d him your Letter.</p>
<p class="indent">‘He said, It was prettily written; and he was sorry for you; and that your good Intentions ought to be encourag’d; but what, said he, would you have me do, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams?</em> Why, suppose Sir, said I, you give her Shelter in your House, with your Spouse and Niece, till she can get to her Friends?—What, and imbroil myself with a Man of the ’Squire’s Power and Fortune! No, not I, I’ll assure you!—And he would have me consider what I was about. Besides, she owns, said he, that he promises to do honourably by her; and her Shyness will procure her good Terms enough; for he is no covetous nor wicked Gentleman; except in this Case; and ’tis what all young Gentlemen will do.</p>
<p class="indent">‘I am greatly concern’d for him, I assure you; but am not discourag’d by this ill Success, let what will come of it, if I can serve you.</p>
<p class="indent">‘I don’t hear, as yet, that the ’Squire is coming; I am glad of your Hint as to that unhappy Fellow <em class="calibre6">John Arnold</em>; something, perhaps, will strike out from that, which may be useful. As to your Pacquets, if you seal them up, and lay them in the usual Place, if you find it not mistrusted, I will watch an Opportunity to convey them; but if they are large, you had best be very cautious. This evil Woman, I find, mistrusts me much.</p>
<p class="indent">‘I just hear that the Gentleman is dying, whose Living the ’Squire has promis’d me. I have almost a Scruple of taking it, as I am acting so contrary to his Desires; but I hope he’ll one Day thank me for it. As to Money, don’t think of it at present. Be assured you may command all in my Power to do for you, without Reserve.</p>
<p class="indent">‘I believe, when we hear he is coming, it will be best to make use of the Key, which I shall soon procure you; and I can borrow a Horse for you, I believe, to wait within half a Mile of the Back-Door, over the Pasture; and will contrive by myself, or somebody, to have you conducted some Miles distant, to some one of the Villages <a id="page_136"></a>thereabouts; so don’t be discomforted, I beseech you. I am, excellent Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>,</p>
<p class="right">‘<em class="calibre6">Your faithful Friend</em>, &amp;c.’</p>
<p class="indent">I made a thousand sad Reflections upon the former Part of this honest Gentleman’s kind Letter; and but for the Hope he gave me at last, should have given up my Case as quite desperate. I then wrote to thank him most gratefully for his kind Endeavour; to lament the little Concern the Gentry had for my deplorable Case; the Wickedness of the World to first give way to such iniquitous Fashions, and then plead the Frequency of them against the Offer to amend them; and how unaffected People were to the Distresses of others. I recall’d my former Hint as to writing to Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>, which I fear’d, I said, would only serve to apprize her Brother, that she knew his wicked Scheme, and more harden him in it, and make him come down the sooner, and to be the more determin’d on my Ruin; besides, that it might make Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> guess’d at, as a means of conveying my Letter; and being very fearful, that if that good Lady would interest herself in my Behalf, (which was a Doubt, because she both lov’d and fear’d her Brother) it would have no Effect upon him; and that, therefore, I would wait the happy Event I might hope for from his kind Assistance in the Key and the Horse, <em class="calibre6">&amp;c</em>. I intimated my Master’s Letter, begging to be permitted to come down; was fearful it might be sudden; and that I was of Opinion no Time was to be lost; for we might lose all our Opportunities, <em class="calibre6">&amp;c</em>. telling him the Money-trick of this vile Woman, <em class="calibre6">&amp;c</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">I had not time to take a Copy of this Letter, I was so watch’d. But when I had it ready in my Bosom, I was easy. And so I went to seek out Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, and told her I would have her Advice upon the Letter I had receiv’d from my Master, which Point of Confidence in her, pleas’d her not a little. Ay, said she, now this is something like. Why, we’ll take a Turn in the Garden, or where you please. I pretended it was indifferent to me; and so we walk’d into the Garden. I began to talk to her of the Letter; but was far from acquainting her with all the Contents; only that he wanted my Consent to come down, and hop’d she us’d me kindly, <em class="calibre6">&amp;c</em>. And I said, Now, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, let me have your Advice as to this. Why then, said she, I will give it you freely. E’en send to him to come down. It will highly oblige him, and I dare say you’ll fare the better for it. How the <a id="page_137"></a>better? said I—I dare say, you think yourself that he intends my Ruin. I hate, said she, that foolish Word; <em class="calibre6">your Ruin!</em>—Why ne’er a Lady in the Land may live happier than you, if you will, or be more honourably used.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, said I, I shall not at this time dispute with you about the Words <em class="calibre6">Ruin</em> or <em class="calibre6">honourable</em>. I thank God, we have quite different Notions of both; but now I will speak plainer than ever I did. Do you think he intends to make Proposals to me, as to a kept Mistress, or kept Slave rather; or do you not?—Why, Lambkin, said she, what dost thou think thyself?—I fear, said I, he does. Well, said she, but if he does, for I know nothing of the Matter, I assure you; you may have your own Terms—I see that; for you may do any thing with him.</p>
<p class="indent">I could not bear this to be spoken, tho’ it was all I fear’d of a long time; and began to exclaim most sadly. Nay, said she, he may marry you, as far as I know.—No, no, said I, that cannot be—I neither desire nor expect it. His Condition don’t permit me to have such a Thought, and that, and the whole Series of his Conduct to me, convinces me of the contrary; and you would have me invite him to come down, would you? Is not this to invite my Ruin?</p>
<p class="indent">’Tis what I would do, said she, in your Place; and if it was to be as you <em class="calibre6">think</em>, I should rather be out of my Pain, than live in continual Frights and Apprehensions, as you do. No, said I, an Hour of Innocence is worth an Age of Guilt; and were my Life to be made ever so miserable by it, I should never forgive myself, if I were not to lengthen out to the longest Minute my happy Time of Honesty. Who knows what God may do for me!</p>
<p class="indent">Why, may-be, said she, as he loves you so well, you may prevail upon him by your Prayers and Tears; and for that Reason, I should think you’d better let him come down. Well, said I, I will write him a Letter, because he expects an Answer, or may-be he will make that a Pretence to come down. You’ll send it for me. How can it go?</p>
<p class="indent">I’ll take care of that, said she; it is in my Instructions—Ay, thought I, so I doubt, by the Hint Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> gave me, about the Post-house.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">The Gardener coming by, I said, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Jacob</em> I have planted a few Beans, and I call it my Garden. It is just by the Door out-yonder, I’ll shew it you; pray don’t dig them up. So I went on with him; and <a id="page_138"></a>when we had turn’d the Alley out of her Sight, and were near the Place, said I, Pray step to Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, and ask her if she has any more Beans for me to plant? He smil’d, I suppose at my Foolishness, and I popt the Letter under the Mould, and stept back, as if waiting for his Return; which being near, was immediate, and she follow’d him. What should I do with Beans? said she—and sadly scar’d me; for she whisper’d me, I am afraid of some Fetch! you don’t use to send of such simple Errands—What Fetch? said I; it is hard I can neither stir, nor speak, but I must be suspected—Why, said she, my Master writes me, that I must have all my Eyes about me; for, tho’ you are as innocent as a Dove, yet you’re as cunning as a Serpent.<a id="exp-note_29"></a><a href="part0021_split_029.html#exp-note-29" class="nounder">*</a> But I’ll forgive you if you cheat me!</p>
<p class="indent">Then I thought of my Money, and could have call’d her Names, had I dar’d: And I said, Pray, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, now you talk of forgiving me if I cheat you; be so kind as to pay me my Money; for tho’ I have no Occasion for it, yet I know you was but in Jest, and intended to give it me again. You shall have it in a proper time, said she; but, indeed, I was in earnest to get it out of your Hands, for fear you should make an ill Use of it. And so we cavilled upon this Subject as we walk’d in, and I went up to write my Letter to my Master; and, as I intended to shew it her, I resolved to write accordingly as to her Part of it; for I made little Account of the Offer of Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em> to me, instead of this wicked Woman, (tho’ the most agreeable thing that could have befallen me, except my Escape from hence) nor indeed of any thing he said: For to be honourable, in the just Sense of the Word, he need not have caus’d me to be run away with, and confin’d as I am. I wrote as follows:<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">‘<em class="calibre6">Honoured Sir</em>,</p>
<p class="noindent">‘WHEN I consider how easy it is for you to make me happy, since all I desire is to be permitted to go to my poor Father and Mother: When I reflect upon your former Proposal to me, in relation to a certain Person, not one Word of which is now mentioned; and upon my being in that strange manner run away with, and still kept here a miserable Prisoner; do you think, Sir, (pardon your poor Servant’s Freedom; my Fears make me bold; do you think, I say) that your general Assurances of Honour to me, can have the Effect upon me, that, were it not for these Things, all your Words ought to have?—O good Sir! I too much apprehend, that <em class="calibre6">your</em> Notions of Honour and <a id="page_139"></a><em class="calibre6">mine</em> are very different from one another: And I have no other Hope but in your continued Absence. If you have any Proposals to make me, that are consistent with your honourable Professions, in my humble Sense of the Word, a few Lines will communicate them to me, and I will return such an Answer as befits me. But, Oh! what Proposals can one in your high Station have to make to one in my low one! I know what belongs to your Degree too well, to imagine, that any thing can be expected but sad Temptations, and utter Distress, if you come down; and you know not, Sir, when I am made desperate, what the wretched <em class="calibre6">Pamela dares to do!</em></p>
<p class="indent">‘Whatever Rashness you may impute to me, I cannot help it, but I wish I may not be forced upon any, that otherwise would never enter into my Thoughts. Forgive me, Sir, my Plainness; I should be loth to behave to my Master unbecomingly; but I must needs say, Sir, my Innocence is so dear to me, that all other Considerations are, and, I hope, shall ever be, treated by me as Niceties, that ought, for that, to be dispensed with. If you mean honourably, why, Sir, should you not let me know it plainly? Why is it necessary to imprison me, to convince me of it? And why must I be close watch’d and attended, hinder’d from stirring out, from speaking to any body, from going so much as to Church to pray for you, who have been till of late so generous a Benefactor to me? Why, Sir, I humbly ask, why all this, if you mean honourably?—It is not for me to expostulate so freely, but in a Case so near to me, with you, Sir, so infinitely my Superior. Pardon me, I hope you will; but as to any the least Desire of seeing you, I cannot so much as bear the dreadful Apprehension. Whatever you have to propose, whatever you intend by me, let my Assent be that of a free Person, mean as I am, and not of a sordid Slave, who is to be threatened and frightened into a Compliance, that your Conduct to her seems to imply would be otherwise abhorr’d by her.—My Restraint is indeed hard upon me. I am very uneasy under it. Shorten it, I beseech you, or—But I will not dare to say more, than that I am</p>
<p class="right">‘<em class="calibre6">Your greatly oppressed unhappy Servant</em>.’</p>
<p class="indent">After I had taken a Copy of this, I folded it up, and Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> coming up, just as I had done, sat down by me, and said, when she saw me direct it, I wish you would tell me if you have taken my Advice, and consented to my Master’s coming down. If it will oblige <a id="page_140"></a>you, said I, I will read it to you. That’s good, said she, then I’ll love you dearly.—Says I, then you must not offer to alter one Word. I won’t, said she; so I read it to her, and she prais’d me much for my Wording it; but said, she thought I push’d the Matter very close; and it would better bear talking of, than writing about. She wanted an Explanation or two, as about the Proposal to a <em class="calibre6">certain Person</em>; but I said she must take it as she heard it. Well, well, said she, I make no doubt you understand one another, and will do so more and more. I seal’d up the Letter, and she undertook to convey it.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">SUNDAY</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">FOR my part, I knew it in vain, to expect to have Leave to go to Church now, and so I did not ask; and I was the more indifferent, because, if I might have had Permission, the Sight of the neighbouring Gentry, who had despis’d my Sufferings, would have given me great Regret and Sorrow, and it was impossible I should have edify’d under any Doctrine preached by Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em>: So I apply’d myself to my private Devotions.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> came Yesterday, and this Day, as usual, and took my Letter; but having no good Opportunity, we avoided one another’s Conversation, and kept at a Distance: But I was concern’d I had not the Key; for I would not have lost a Moment in that Case, had it been me. When I was at my Devotions, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> came up, and wanted me sadly to sing her a Psalm, as she had often on common Days importun’d me for a Song upon the Spinnet; but I declin’d it, because my Spirits were so low, I could hardly speak, nor car’d to be spoke to; but when she was gone, I remembering the 137th Psalm to be a little touching, turn’d to it, and took the Liberty to alter it to my Case more; I hope I did not sin in it: But thus I turn’d it.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>

<p class="noindent">I Write now with a little more Liking, tho’ less Opportunity, because Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> has got a large Parcel of my Papers safe, in his Hands, to send them to you, as he has Opportunity; so I am not quite uselessly employ’d; and I am deliver’d, besides, from the Fear of their being found, if I should be search’d, or discover’d. I have been permitted to take an Airing five or six Miles, with Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>: But, tho’ I know not the Reason, she watches me more closely than ever; so that we have discontinued, by Consent, for these three Days, the Sun-flower Correspondence.</p>
<p class="indent">The poor Cook-maid has had a bad Mischance; for she has been hurt much by a Bull in the Pasture, by the Side of the Garden, not far from the Back-door. Now this Pasture I am to cross, which is about half a Mile, and then comes to a Common, and near that a private Horse-road, where I hope to find an Opportunity for escaping, as soon as Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> can get me a Horse, and has made all ready for me: For he has got me the Key, which he put under the Mould, just by the Door, as he found an Opportunity to hint to me.</p>
<p class="indent">He just now has signify’d, that the Gentleman is dead, whose Living he has had Hope of, and he came pretendedly to tell Mrs. <a id="page_143"></a><em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> of it, and so could speak this to her, before me. She wish’d him Joy; see what the World is! one Man’s Death is another Man’s Joy: Thus we thrust out one another!—My hard Case makes me serious. He found means to slide a Letter into my Hands, and is gone away: He look’d at me with such Respect and Solemnness at Parting, that Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> said, Why, Madam, I believe our young Parson is half in Love with you—Ah! Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, said I, he knows better. Said she, (I believe to sound me) Why I can’t see you can either of you do better; and I have lately been so touch’d for you, seeing how heavily you apprehend Dishonour from my Master, that I think it is Pity you should not have Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">I knew this must be a Fetch of hers, because, instead of being troubled for me, she had watched me closer, and him too; and so I said, There is not the Man living, that I desire to marry; if I can but keep myself honest, it is all my Desire; and to be a Comfort and Assistance to my poor Parents, if it should be my happy Lot to be so, is the very Top of my Ambition. Well, but, said she, I have been thinking very seriously, that Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> would make you a good Husband, and as he will owe all his Fortune to my Master, he will be very glad, to be sure, to be oblig’d to him for a Wife of his chusing: Especially, said she, such a pretty one, and one so ingenious and genteelly educated.</p>
<p class="indent">This gave me a Doubt, whether she knew of my Master’s Intimation of that sort formerly; and I asked her, if she had Reason to surmize, that that was in View? No, she said; it was only her own Thought; but it was very likely that my Master had either that in View, or something better for me. But, if I approv’d of it, she would propose such a thing to her Master directly; and gave a detestable Hint, that I might take Resolutions upon it, of bringing such an Affair to Effect. I told her, I abhorr’d her Insinuation; and as to Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, I thought him a civil good sort of Man; but as on one side, he was above me; so on the other, of all Things, I did not love a Parson. So finding she could make nothing of me, she quitted the Subject.</p>
<p class="indent">I will open his Letter by-and-by, and give you the Contents of it; for she is up and down, so much, that I am afraid of her catching me.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">Well, I see Providence has not abandon’d me. I shall be under no <a id="page_144"></a>Necessity to make Advances to Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, if I was, as I am sure I am not, dispos’d to it. This is his Letter.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="noindent">‘I Know not how to express myself, lest I should appear to you to have a selfish View in the Service I would do you. But I really know but one effectual and honourable Way to disengage yourself, from the dangerous Situation you are in. It is that of Marriage with some Person that you could make happy in your Approbation. As for my own part, it would be, as Things stand, my apparent Ruin; and, worse still, I should involve you in Misery too. But yet, so great is my Veneration for you, and so intire my Reliance in Providence, on so just an Occasion, that I should think myself but too happy, if I might be accepted. I would, in this Case, forego all my Expectations, and be your Conductor to some safe Distance. But why do I say, <em class="calibre6">in this Case?</em> That I will do, whether you think fit to reward me so eminently or not. And I will, the Moment I hear of the ’Squire’s setting out, (and I think now I have settled a very good Method of Intelligence of all his Motions) get the Horse ready, and myself to conduct you. I refer myself wholly to your Goodness and Direction, and am, with the highest Respect,</p>
<p class="right">‘<em class="calibre6">Your most faithful humble Servant</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">‘Don’t think this a sudden Resolution. I always admir’d your hearsay Character; and the Moment I saw you, wish’d to serve so much Excellence.’<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">What shall I say, my dear Father and Mother, to this unexpected Declaration? I want now more than ever your Blessing and Direction. But after all, I have no Mind to marry. I had rather live with you. But yet, I would marry a Man who begs from Door to Door, and has no Home nor Being, rather than indanger my Honesty. Yet, I cannot, methinks, hear of being a Wife.—After a thousand different Thoughts, I wrote as follows.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>

<p class="noindent">‘I Am much confused at the Contents of your last. You are much too generous, and I can’t bear you should risque all your future Prospects for so unworthy a Creature. I cannot think of your Offer without equal Concern and Gratitude; for nothing but to avoid my utter Ruin can make me think of a Change of Condition; and so, Sir, <a id="page_145"></a>you ought not to accept of such an involuntary Compliance, as mine would be, were I, upon the last Necessity, to yield to your very generous Proposal. I will rely wholly upon your Goodness to me, in assisting my Escape; but shall not, on your account principally, think of the Honour you propose for me, at present; and never, but at the Pleasure of my Parents, who, poor as they are, in such a weighty Point, are as much intitled to my Obedience and Duty, as if they were ever so rich.

<p class="noindent">MRS. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> has received a Letter, and is much civiller to me, and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> too, than she used to be. I wonder I have not one in Answer to mine to my Master. I suppose I press’d the Matter too home to him; and he is angry. I am not the more pleas’d for her Civility; for she is horrid cunning, and is not a bit less watchful. I laid a Trap to get at her Instructions, which she carries in the Bosom of her Stays, but it has not succeeded.</p>
<p class="indent">My last Letter is come safe to Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, by the old Conveyance, so that is not suspected. He has intimated, that tho’ I have not come so readily as he hop’d into his Scheme, yet his Diligence shall not be slacken’d, and he will leave it to Providence and myself, to dispose of him as he shall be found to deserve. He has signify’d to me, that he shall soon send a special Messenger with the Pacquet to you, and I have added to it what has occurr’d since.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">SUNDAY</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">I Am just now quite astonish’d!—I hope all is right!—But I have a strange Turn to acquaint you with. Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> and Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> came to me both together; he in Ecstacies, she with a strange fluttering sort of Air. Well, said she, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, I give you Joy! I give you Joy!—Let nobody speak but me! Then she sat down, as out of Breath, puffing and blowing. Why every thing turns as I said it would, said she! Why there is to be a Match between you and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams!</em> Well, I always thought it. Never was so good a Master! Go to, go to, naughty mistrustful Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, nay, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, said <a id="page_146"></a>the forward Creature, I may as good as call you, you ought on your Knees to beg his Pardon a thousand times for mistrusting him.</p>
<p class="indent">She was going on; but I said, Don’t torture me thus, I beseech you, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>. Let me know all!—Ah! Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, said I, take care, take care!—Mistrustful again, said she! why, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, shew her your Letter; and I will shew her mine: They were brought by the same Hand.</p>
<p class="indent">I trembled at the Thoughts of what this might mean; and said, You have so surpriz’d me, that I cannot stand, nor hear, nor read! Why did you come up in such a manner to attack such weak Spirits? Said he, to Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, Shall we leave our Letters with Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, and let her recover from her Surprize? Ay, said she, with all my Heart; here is nothing but flaming Honour and Good-will! And so saying, they left me their Letters, and withdrew.</p>
<p class="indent">My Heart was quite sick with the Surprize; so that I could not presently read them, notwithstanding my Impatience; but after a while, recovering, I found the Contents thus strange and wonderful.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">‘<em class="calibre6">Mr</em>. W<small class="calibre2">ILLIAMS</small>,</p>
<p class="noindent">‘THE Death of Mr. <em class="calibre6">Fownes</em> has now given me the Opportunity I have long wanted to make you happy, and that in a double respect. For I shall soon put you in Possession of his Living, and, if you have the Art of making yourself well receiv’d, of one of the loveliest Wives in <em class="calibre6">England</em>. She has not been used (as she has reason to think) according to her Merit; but when she finds herself under the Protection of a Man of Virtue and Probity, and a happy Competency to support Life in the manner to which she has been of late Years accustom’d, I am persuaded she will forgive those seeming Hardships which have pav’d the Way to so happy a Lot, as I hope it will be to you both. I have only to account for and excuse the odd Conduct I have been guilty of, which I shall do, when I see you: But as I shall soon set out for <em class="calibre6">London</em>, I believe it will not be yet this Month. Mean time, if you can prevail with <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, you need not suspend for that your mutual Happiness; only, let me have Notice of it first, and that she approves of it; which ought to be, in so material a Point, intirely at her Option, as I assure you, on the other hand, I would have it on yours, that nothing may be wanting to complete your Happiness. I am</p>
<p class="right">‘<em class="calibre6">Your humble Servant</em>.’</p>
<p class="hangingpara"><a id="page_147"></a>Was ever the like heard!—Lie still, my throbbing Heart, divided, as thou art, between thy Hopes and thy Fears!—But this is the Letter Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> left with me.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">‘<em class="calibre6">Mrs</em>. J<small class="calibre2">EWKES</small>,</p>
<p class="noindent">‘YOU have been very careful and diligent in the Task, which, for Reasons I shall hereafter explain, I had impos’d upon you. Your Trouble is now almost at an End; for I have wrote my Intentions to Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> so particularly, that I need say the less here, because he will not scruple, I believe, to let you know the Contents of my Letter. I have only one Thing to mention, that if you find what I have hinted to him in the least measure disagreeable to either, that you assure them both that they are at intire Liberty to pursue their own Inclinations. I hope you continue your Civilities to the mistrustful, uneasy <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, who now will begin to think better of hers and</p>
<p class="right">‘<em class="calibre6">Your Friend, &amp;c</em>.’</p>
<p class="indent">I had hardly time to transcribe these Letters, tho’ writing so much, I write pretty fast, before they both came up again, in high Spirits; and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> said, I am glad at my Heart, Madam, that I was <em class="calibre6">before-hand</em> in my Declarations to you: This generous Letter has made me the happiest Man on Earth; and, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, you may be sure, that if I can procure this Fair-one’s Consent, I shall think myself—I interrupted the good Man, and said, Ah! Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, take care, take care; don’t let—There I stopt, and Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> said, Still mistrustful!—I never saw the like in my Life!—But I see, said she, I was not wrong while my old Orders lasted, to be wary of you both.—I should have had a hard Task to prevent you, I find; for, as the Saying is, <em class="calibre6">Nought can restrain Consent of Twain</em>.<a id="exp-note_31"></a><a href="part0021_split_031.html#exp-note-31" class="nounder">*</a></p>
<p class="indent">I doubted not her taking hold of his joyful Indiscretion.—I took her Letter, and said, Here, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, is yours; I thank you for it; but I have been so long in a Maze, that I can say nothing of this for the present. Time will bring all to Light.—Sir, said I, here is yours: May every thing turn to your Happiness! I give you Joy of my Master’s Goodness in the Living—It will be <em class="calibre6">dying</em>, said he, not a <em class="calibre6">Living</em>, without you.—Forbear, Sir, said I: While I’ve a Father and Mother, I am not my own Mistress, poor as they are: And I’ll see myself quite at Liberty before I shall think myself fit to make a Choice.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_148"></a>Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> held up her Eyes and Hands, and said, Such Art, such Caution, such Cunning for thy Years!—Well!—Why, said I, (that he might be more on his Guard, tho’ I hope there cannot be Deceit in this; ’twould be strange Villainy, and that is a hard Word, if there should!) I have been so used to be made a Fool of by Fortune, that I hardly can tell how to govern myself; and am almost an Infidel as to Mankind.—But I hope, I may be wrong; henceforth, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, you shall regulate my Opinions as you please, and I will consult you in every thing——(that I think proper, said I to myself)—for to be sure, tho’ I may forgive her, I can never love her.</p>
<p class="indent">She left Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> and me, a few Minutes, together; and I said, Consider, Sir, consider what you have done. ’Tis impossible, said he, there can be Deceit. I hope so, said I; but what Necessity was there for you to talk of your <em class="calibre6">former</em> Declaration? Let this be as it will, that could do no Good, especially before this Woman. Forgive me, Sir; they talk of Womens Promptness of Speech; but indeed I see an honest Heart is not always to be trusted with itself in bad Company.</p>
<p class="indent">He was going to reply; but, tho’ her Task is said to be <small class="calibre2">ALMOST</small> (I took Notice of that Word) at an End, she came up to us again; and said, Well, I had a good mind to shew you the way to Church tomorrow. I was glad of this, because, tho’, in my present doubtful Situation, I should not have chosen it, yet I would have encourag’d her Proposal, to be able to judge by her being in Earnest or otherwise, whether one might depend upon the rest. But Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> again indiscreetly help’d her to an Excuse; by saying, that it was now best to defer it one <em class="calibre6">Sunday</em>, and till Matters were riper for my Appearance; and she readily took hold of it.</p>
<p class="indent">After all, I hope the best; but if this should turn out to be a Plot, I fear nothing but a Miracle can save me. But, sure the Heart of Man is not capable of such black Deceit. Besides, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> has it under his own Hand, and he dare not but be in Earnest; and then again, tho’ to be sure he has been very wrong to me, yet his Education, and Parents Example, have neither of them taught him such very black Contrivances. So I will hope for the best!—<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> and I, have been all three walking together in the Garden; and she pull’d out her Key, and we walk’d a little in the Pasture to look at the Bull, an ugly, grim, surly Creature, that hurt the poor Cook-maid, who is got pretty well again. Mr. <a id="page_149"></a><em class="calibre6">Williams</em> pointed at the Sun-flower, but I was forc’d to be very reserved to him; for the poor Gentlemen has no Guard, no Caution at all.</p>
<p class="indent">We have just supp’d together, all three; and I cannot yet think but all must be right.—Only I am resolv’d not to marry, if I can help it; and I will give no Encouragement, I am resolv’d, at least, till I am with you.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> said, before Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, he would send a Messenger with a Letter to my Father and Mother!—I think the Man has no Discretion in the World: But I desire you will give no Answer till I have the Pleasure and Happiness, which now I hope for soon, of seeing you. He will, in sending my Pacquet, send a most tedious Parcel of Stuff, of my <em class="calibre6">Oppressions</em>, my <em class="calibre6">Distresses</em>, my <em class="calibre6">Fears</em>; and so I will send this with it (for Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> gives me Leave to send a Letter to my Father, which looks well); and I am glad I can conclude, after all my Sufferings, with my <em class="calibre6">Hopes</em>, to be soon with you, which I know will give you Comfort; and so I rest, begging the Continuance of your Prayers, and Blessings,</p>
<p class="right"><em class="calibre6">Your ever dutiful Daughter</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre6">My dear Father and Mother</em>,</p>
<p class="noindent">I Have so much Time upon my Hands, that I must write on to employ myself. The <em class="calibre6">Sunday Evening</em>, where I left off, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> asked me, If I chose to lie by myself? I said, Yes, with all my Heart, if she pleased. Well, said she, after tonight you shall. I ask’d her for more Paper, and she gave me a little Bottle of Ink, eight Sheets of Paper, which she said was all her Store, (for now she would get me to write for her to our Master, if she had Occasion) and six Pens, with a Piece of Sealing-wax. This looks mighty well!</p>
<p class="indent">She press’d me, when she came to Bed, very much, to give Encouragement to Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, and said many Things in his Behalf; and blam’d my Shyness to him, <em class="calibre6">&amp;c</em>. I told her, I was resolv’d to give no Encouragement till I had talk’d to my Father and Mother. She said, she fancy’d I thought of somebody else, or I could never be so insensible. I assur’d her, as I could do very safely, that there was not a Man on Earth I wish’d to have; and, as to Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, he <a id="page_150"></a>might do better by far, and I had proposed so much Happiness in living with my poor Father and Mother, that I could not think of any Scheme of Life, with Pleasure, till I had try’d that. I ask’d her for my Money; and she said it was above in her strong Box, but that I shall have it to-morrow. All these Things look well, as I said.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> would go home this Night, tho’ late, because he would dispatch a Messenger to you with a Letter he had propos’d from himself, and my Pacquet. But pray don’t encourage him, as I said; for he is much too heady and precipitate as to this Matter, in my way of thinking; tho’, to be sure, he is a very good Man, and I am much oblig’d to him.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">MONDAY Morning</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">Alas-a-day! we have bad News from poor Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>. He has had a sad Mischance; fallen among Rogues in his Way home last Night; but by good Chance has sav’d my Papers. This is the Account he gives of it to Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">‘<em class="calibre6">Good Mrs</em>. J<small class="calibre2">EWKES</small>,</p>
<p class="noindent">‘I Have had a sore Misfortune in going from you; when I had got as near the Town as the Dam, and was going to cross the Wooden-bridge, two Fellows got hold of me, and swore bitterly they would kill me, if I did not give them what I had. They romag’d my Pockets, and took from me my Snuff-Box, my Seal-ring, and Half a Guinea, and some Silver, and Half-pence; also my Handkerchief, and two or three Letters I had in my Pocket. By good Fortune the Letter Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> gave me was in my Bosom, and so that escap’d; but they bruis’d my Head, and Face, and cursing me for having no more Money, tipt me into the Dam, Crying, Lie there, Parson, till to-morrow! My Shins and Knees were bruis’d much in the Fall against one of the Stumps; and I had like to have been suffocated in Water and Mud. To be sure, I shan’t be able to stir out this Day or two. For I am a fearful Spectacle! My Hat and Wig I was forc’d to leave behind me, and go home a Mile and a Half without; but they were found next Morning, and brought me, with my Snuff-box, which the Rogues must have dropt. My Cassock is sadly torn, as is my Band. To be sure, I was much frighted; for a Robbery in these Parts has not been known many Years. Diligent Search is making after the Rogues. My humblest <a id="page_151"></a>Respects to good Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>. If she pities my Misfortunes, I shall be the sooner well, and fit to wait on her and you. This did not hinder me in writing a Letter, tho’ with great Pain, as I do this;’ [<em class="calibre6">To be sure this good Man can keep no Secret!</em>] ‘and sending it away by a Man and Horse, this Morning. I am, good Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>,</p>
<p class="right">‘<em class="calibre6">Your most obliged humble Servant</em>.</p>
<p class="hangingpara">‘God be prais’d it is no worse! and I find I have got no Cold, tho’ miserably wet from Top to Toe. My Fright, I believe, prevented me catching Cold; for I was not rightly myself for some Hours, and know not how I got home. I will write a Letter of Thanks this Night, if I am able, to my kind Patron for his inestimable Goodness to me. I wish I was enabled to say all I hope, with regard to the <em class="calibre6">better Part</em> of his Bounty to me, incomparable Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>.’<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">The wicked Brute fell a laughing when she had read this Letter, till her fat Sides shook; said she, I can but think how the poor Parson look’d, after parting with his pretty Mistress in such high Spirits, when he found himself at the Bottom of the Dam! And what a Figure he must cut in his tatter’d Band and Cassock, and without Hat and Wig, when he got home. I warrant, said she, he was in a sweet Pickle!—I said, I thought it was very barbarous to laugh at such a Misfortune: But she said, As he was safe, she laughed; otherwise she should have been sorry: And she was glad to see me so concern’d for him—It look’d <em class="calibre6">promising</em>, she said.</p>
<p class="indent">I heeded not her Reflection; but as I have been used to Causes for Mistrusts, I cannot help saying, that I don’t like this thing: And their taking his Letters most alarms me.—How happy it was, they miss’d my Pacquet! I know not what to think of it!—But why should I let every Accident break my Peace? But yet it will do so while I stay here.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> is mightily at me, to go with her in the Chariot, to visit Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>. She is so officious to bring on the Affair between us, that being a cunning, artful Woman, I know not what to make of it: I have refused her absolutely; urging, that except I intended to encourage his Suit, I ought not to do it. And she is gone without me.</p>
<p class="indent">I have strange Temptations to get away in her Absence, for all these fine Appearances. ’Tis sad to have no body to advise with!—I <a id="page_152"></a>know not what to do. But, alas for me! I have no Money, if I should, to buy any body’s Civilities, or to pay for Necessaries or Lodging. But I’ll go into the Garden, and resolve afterwards.—<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="blockquote1">I have been in the Garden, and to the Back-door; and there I stood, my Heart up at my Mouth. I could not see I was watch’d; so this looks well. But if any thing should go bad afterwards, I should never forgive myself, for not taking this Opportunity. Well, I will go down again, and see if all is clear, and how it looks out at the Back-door in the Pasture.</p>
<p class="indent">To be sure, there is Witchcraft in this House; and I believe <em class="calibre6">Lucifer</em> is bribed, as well as all about me, and is got into the Shape of that nasty grim Bull, to watch me!—For I have been down again; and ventur’d to open the Door, and went out about a Bow-shoot into the Pasture; but there stood that horrid Bull, staring me full in the Face, with fiery Saucer Eyes, as I thought. So, I got in again; for fear he should come at me. Nobody saw me, however.—Do you think there are such things as Witches and Spirits? If there be, I believe in my Heart, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> has got this Bull of her Side. But yet, what could I do without Money or a Friend?—O this wicked Woman! to trick me so! Every thing, Man, Woman and Beast, is in a Plot against your poor <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, I think!—Then I know not one Step of the Way, nor how far to any House or Cottage; and whether I could gain Protection, if I got to a House: And now the Robbers are abroad too, I may run into as great Danger, as I want to escape from; nay, greater much, if these promising Appearances hold: And sure my Master cannot be so black as that they should not!—What can I do?—I have a good mind to try for it once more; but then I may be pursued and taken; and it will be worse for me; and this wicked Woman will beat me, and take my Shoes away, and lock me up.</p>
<p class="indent">But after all, if my Master should mean <em class="calibre6">well</em>, he can’t be angry at my Fears, if I should escape; and nobody can blame me; and I can more easily be induced with you, when all my Apprehensions are over, to consider his Proposal of Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, than I could here; and he pretends he will leave me at my Choice: Why then should I be afraid? I will go down again, I think! But yet my Heart misgives me, because of the Difficulties before me, in escaping; and being so poor and so friendless!—O good God! the Preserver of the Innocent! direct me what to do!—Well, I have just now a sort of strange <a id="page_153"></a>Persuasion upon me, that I ought to try to get away, and leave the Issue to Providence. So, once more!—I’ll see, at least, if this Bull be still there!</p>
<p class="blockquote1">Alack-a-day! what a Fate is this! I have not the Courage to go, neither can I think to stay. But I must resolve. The Gardener was in Sight last time! so made me come up again. But I’ll contrive to send him out of the way, if I can!—For if I never should have such another Opportunity, I could not forgive myself. Once more I’ll venture. God direct my Footsteps, and make smooth my Path and my Way to Safety!</p>
<p class="indent">Well, here I am, come back again! frighted like a Fool, out of all my Purposes! O how terrible every thing appears to me! I had got twice as far again, as I was before, out of the Back-door; and I looked, and saw the Bull, as I thought, between me and the Door; and another Bull coming towards me the other way: Well, thought I, here is double Witchcraft, to be sure! Here is the Spirit of my Master in one Bull; and Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>’s in the other; and now I am gone, to be sure! O help! cry’d I, like a Fool, and run back to the Door, as swift as if I flew. When I had got the Door in my Hand, I ventur’d to look back, to see if these supposed Bulls were coming; and I saw they were only two poor Cows, a grazing in distant Places, that my Fears had made all this Rout about. But as every thing is so frightful to me, I find I am not fit to think of my Escape: For I shall be as much frighted at the first strange Man that I meet with. And I am persuaded, that Fear brings one into more Dangers, than the Caution, that goes along with it, delivers one from.</p>
<p class="indent">I then locked the Door, and put the Key in my Pocket, and was in a sad Quandary; but I was soon determined; for the Maid <em class="calibre6">Nan</em> came in Sight, and asked, If any thing was the matter, that I was so often up and down Stairs? God forgive me; but I had a sad Lye at my Tongue’s End; said I, Tho’ Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> is sometimes a little hard upon me, yet I know not where I am without her: I go up, and I come down to walk about in the Garden; and not having her, know scarcely what to do with myself. Ay, said the Idiot, she is main good Company, Madam; no wonder you miss her.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">So here I am again; and here likely to be; for I have no Courage to help myself any-where else. O why are poor foolish Maidens try’d <a id="page_154"></a>with such Dangers, when they have such weak Minds to grapple with them!—I will, since it is so, hope the best: But yet I cannot but observe how grievously every thing makes against me: For here are the Robbers; tho’ I fell not into their Hands myself, yet they gave me as much Terror, and had as great an Effect upon my Fears, as if I had: And here is the Bull; it has as effectually frighten’d me, as if I had been hurt by it instead of the Cook-maid; and so they join’d together, as I may say, to make a very Dastard of me. But my Folly was the worst of all; for that depriv’d me of my Money; for had I had that, I believe I should have ventur’d the other Two.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">MONDAY Afternoon</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">SO, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> is returned from her Visit: Well, said she, I would have you set your Heart at Rest; for Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> will do very well again. He is not half so badly off as he fancy’d. O these Scholars, said she, they have not the Hearts of Mice! He has only a few Scratches on his Face; which, said she, I suppose he got by grabbling among the Gravel, at the Bottom of the Dam, to try to find a Hole in the Ground, to hide himself from the Robbers. His Shin and his Knee are hardly to be seen to ail any thing. He says in his Letter, he was a frightful Spectacle: He might be so indeed, when he first came in a-doors; but he looks well enough now; and, only for a few Groans now-and-then, when he thinks of his Danger, I see nothing is the matter with him. So, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said she, I would have you be very easy about it. I am glad of it, said I, for all your Jokes, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, said she, he talks of nothing but you; and when I told him, I would fain have persuaded you to come with me, the Man was out of his Wits with his Gratitude to me; and so has laid open all his Heart to me, and told me all that has passed, and was contriving between you two. This alarm’d me prodigiously; and the rather, as I saw, by two or three Instances, that his honest Heart could keep nothing, believing every one as undesigning as himself. I said, but yet with a heavy Heart, Ah, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, this might have done with me, had he had any thing that he could have told you of! But you know well enough, that had we been disposed, we had no Opportunity for it, from your watchful Care and Circumspection. No, said she, that’s very true, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>; not so much as for that Declaration that he own’d before me, he had found Opportunity, for <a id="page_155"></a>all my Watchfulness, to make you. Come, come, said she, no more of these Shams with me! You have an excellent Head-piece for your Years; but may-be I am as cunning as you.—However, said she, all is well now; because my <em class="calibre6">Watchments</em> are now over, by my Master’s Direction. How have you employ’d yourself in my Absence?</p>
<p class="indent">I was so troubled at what might have passed between Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> and her, that I could not hide it. And she said, Well, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, since all Matters are likely to be so soon and so happily ended, let me advise you to be a little less concern’d at his Discoveries; and make me your Confident, as <em class="calibre6">he</em> has done, and I shall think you have some Favour for me and Reliance upon me; and perhaps you might not repent it.</p>
<p class="indent">She was so earnest, that I mistrusted she did this to pump me; and I knew how, now, to account for her Kindness to Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, in her Visit to him; which was only to get out of him what she could. Why, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, said I, is all this fishing about for something, where there is nothing, if there be an End of your <em class="calibre6">Watchments</em>, as you call them? Nothing, said she, but Womanish Curiosity, I’ll assure you; for one is naturally led to find out Matters, where there is such Privacy intended. Well, said I, pray let me know what he has said; and then I’ll give you an Answer to your Curiosity. I don’t care, said she, whether you do or not; for I have as much as I wanted from him; and I despair of getting out of you any thing you han’t a mind I should know, my little cunning Dear.—Well, said I, let him have said what he would, I care not; for I am sure he can say no Harm of me; and so let us change the Talk.</p>
<p class="indent">I was the easier indeed; because, for all her Pumps, she gave no Hints of the Key and the Door, <em class="calibre6">&amp;c</em>. which had he communicated to her, she would not have forborn giving me a Touch of.—And so we gave up one another, as despairing to gain our Ends of each other. But I am sure he must have said more than he should.—And I am the more apprehensive all is not right, because she has now been actually, these two Hours, shut up a-writing; tho’ she pretended she had given me up all her Stores of Paper, <em class="calibre6">&amp;c</em>. and that I should write for her. I begin to wish I had ventur’d every thing, and gone off, when I might. O when will this State of Doubt and Uneasiness end!<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">She has just been with me, and says she shall send a Messenger to <em class="calibre6">Bedfordshire</em>; and he shall carry a Letter of Thanks for me, if I will <a id="page_156"></a>write it, for my Master’s Favour to me. Indeed, said I, I have no Thanks to give, till I am with my Father and Mother: And besides, I sent a Letter, as you know; but have had no Answer to it. She said, she thought that his Letter was sufficient to Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>; and the least I could do, was to thank him, if but in two Lines. No need of it, said I; for I don’t intend to have Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>: What then is that Letter to me?—Well, said she, I see thou art quite unfathomable!</p>
<p class="indent">I don’t like all this. O my foolish Fears of Bulls and Robbers!—For now all my Uneasiness begins to double upon me. O what has this uncautious Man said? That, no doubt, is the Subject of her long Letter.</p>
<p class="indent">I will close this Day’s writing, with just saying, that she is mighty silent and reserved, to what she was, and says nothing but No, or Yes, to what I ask. Something must be hatching, I doubt!—I the rather think so, because I find she does not keep her word with me, about lying by myself, and my Money; to both which Points, she return’d suspicious Answers, saying, as to the one, Why you are mighty earnest for your Money: I shan’t run away with it: And to the other, Good lack! you need not be so willing, as I know of, to part with me for a Bedfellow, till you are sure of one you <em class="calibre6">like better</em>. This cut me to the Heart!—And at the same time stopt my Mouth.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">MR. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> has been here; but we have had no Opportunity to talk together: He seem’d confounded at Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>’s Change of Temper, and Reservedness, after her kind Visit, and their Freedom with one another, and much more at what I am going to tell you. He asked, if I would take a Turn in the Garden with Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> and him. No, said she, I can’t go. Said he, May not Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> take a Walk?—No, said she; I desire she won’t. Why, said he, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes?</em> I am afraid I have some-how disobliged you. Not at all, said she; but I suppose you will soon be at Liberty to walk together as much as you please: And I have sent a Messenger for my last Instructions, about <em class="calibre6">this</em> and <em class="calibre6">more</em> weighty Matters; and when they come, I shall leave you to do as you both will; but till then, it is no matter how little you are together. This alarm’d us both; and he seem’d quite struck of a Heap, and put on, as I thought, a self-accusing Countenance. So I went behind her Back, and held my two Hands together, flat, with a Bit of Paper, I had, between them, and looked at him; and he <a id="page_157"></a>seemed to take me, as I intended, intimating the renewing of the Correspondence by the Tiles.</p>
<p class="indent">So I left them both together, and retired to my Closet, to write a Letter for the Tiles; but having no Time for a Copy, I will give you the Substance only.</p>
<p class="indent">I expostulated with him on his too great Openness and Easiness to fall into Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>’s Snares; told him my Apprehensions of foul Play; and gave briefly the Reasons which moved me: Begg’d to know what he had said; and intimated, that I thought there was the highest Reason to resume our Project of the Escape by the Back-door. I put this in the usual Place, in the Evening, and now wait with Impatience for an Answer.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">THURSDAY</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">I Have the following Answer:<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">‘<em class="calibre6">Dearest Madam</em>,</p>
<p class="noindent">‘I Am utterly confounded, and must plead guilty to all your just Reproaches. O that I was Master of half your Caution and Discretion! I hope, after all, this is only a Touch of this ill Woman’s Temper, to shew her Power and Importance: For I think Mr. <em class="calibre6">B</em>. neither can nor dare deceive me in so black a manner. I would expose him all the World over, if he did. But it is not, cannot be in him. I have received a Letter from <em class="calibre6">John Arnold</em>; in which he tells me, that the ’Squire is preparing for his <em class="calibre6">London</em> Journey; and believes, afterwards, he will come into these Parts. But he says, Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> is at their House, and is to accompany her Brother to <em class="calibre6">London</em>, or meet him there, he knows not which. He professes great Zeal and Affection to your Service. But I find he refers to a Letter he sent me before, but which is not come to my Hand. I think there can be no Treachery; for it is a particular Friend at <em class="calibre6">Gainsborough<a id="exp-note_32"></a><a href="part0021_split_032.html#exp-note-32" class="nounder">*</a></em> that I have order’d him to direct to; and this is come safe to my Hands by this means; for well I know, I durst trust nothing to <em class="calibre6">Brett</em>, at the Post-house here. This gives me a little Pain; but I hope all will end well, and we shall soon hear, if it be necessary to pursue our former Intentions. If it be, I will lose no Time to provide a Horse for you, and another for myself; for I can never do either God or myself better Service, tho’ I were to forego all my Expectations for it here. I am</p>
<p class="right">‘<em class="calibre6">Your most faithful humble Servant</em>.</p>
<p class="hangingpara"><a id="page_158"></a>‘I was too free indeed with Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, led to it by her Dissimulation, and by her Concern to make me happy with you. I hinted, that I would not have scrupled to have procured your Deliverance by any means; and that I had proposed to you, as the only honourable one, Marriage with me. But I assured her, tho’ she would hardly believe me, that you discouraged my Application. Which is too true! But not a Word of the Back-door, Key, <em class="calibre6">&amp;c</em>.’</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> continues still sullen and ill-natur’d; and I am afraid, almost, to speak to her. She watches me as close as ever, and pretends to wonder why I shun her Company as I do.</p>
<p class="indent">I have just put under the Tiles these Lines; inspired by my Fears, which are indeed very strong; and, I doubt, not without Reason.</p>
<p class="indent">‘<em class="calibre6">Sir</em>,</p>
<p class="noindent">‘EVERY thing gives me additional Disturbance. The miss’d Letter of <em class="calibre6">John Arnold</em>’s makes me suspect a Plot. Yet am I loth to think myself of so much Importance, as to suppose every one in a Plot against me. Are you sure, however, the <em class="calibre6">London</em> Journey is not to be a <em class="calibre6">Lincolnshire</em> one? May not <em class="calibre6">John</em>, who has been once a Traitor, be so again?—Why need I be thus in doubt?—If I could have this Horse, I would turn the Reins on his Neck, and trust to Providence to guide him for my Safeguard! For I would not indanger you, now just upon the Edge of your Preferment. Yet, Sir, I fear your fatal Openness will make you suspected as accessary, let us be ever so cautious.</p>
<p class="indent">‘Were my Life in question, instead of my Honesty, I would not wish to involve you, or any body, in the least Difficulty for so worthless a poor Creature. But, O Sir! my Soul is of equal Importance with the Soul of a Princess; though my Quality is inferior to that of the meanest Slave.</p>
<p class="indent">‘Save then, my Innocence, good God, and preserve my Mind spotless; and happy shall I be to lay down my worthless Life, and see an End to all my Troubles and Anxieties!</p>
<p class="indent">‘Forgive my Impatience: But my presaging Mind bodes horrid Mischiefs!—Every thing looks dark around me; and this Woman’s impenetrable Sullenness and Silence, without any apparent Reason, from a Conduct so very contrary, bids me fear the worst.—Blame me, Sir, if you think me wrong; and let me have your Advice what to do: which will oblige</p>
<p class="right">‘<em class="calibre6">Your most afflicted Servant</em>.’</p>
<h4 class="h3"><a id="page_159"></a><em class="calibre6">FRIDAY</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">I Have this half-angry Answer; but, what is more to me than all the Letters in the World could be, yours, my dear Father, inclosed.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">‘<em class="calibre6">Madam</em>,</p>
<p class="noindent">‘I Think you are too apprehensive by much. I am sorry for your Uneasiness. You may depend upon me, and all I can do. But I make no doubt of the <em class="calibre6">London</em> Journey, nor of <em class="calibre6">ohn</em>’s Contrition and Fidelity. I have just received, from my <em class="calibre6">Gainsborough</em> Friend, this Letter, as I suppose, from your good Father, in a Cover, as directed for me, as I had desired. I hope it contains nothing to add to your Uneasiness. Pray, dearest Madam, lay aside your Fears, and wait a few Days for the Issue of <em class="calibre6">Mrs. Jewkes</em>’s Letter, and mine of Thanks to the ’Squire. Things, I hope, must be better than you expect. God Almighty will not desert such Piety and Innocence; and be this your Comfort and Reliance. Which is the best Advice that can at present be given, by</p>
<p class="right">‘<em class="calibre6">Your most faithful humble Servant</em>.’</p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre6">N.B</em>. The Father’s Letter was as follows:<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">‘<em class="calibre6">My dearest Daughter</em>,</p>
<p class="noindent">‘GOD has at length heard our Prayers, and we are overwhelmed with his Goodness. O what Sufferings, what Trials hast thou gone thro’! and, blessed be God, who enabled thee, what Temptations hast thou withstood! We have not yet had Leisure to read thro’ your long Accounts of all your Hardships. I say <em class="calibre6">long</em>, because I wonder how you could find Time and Opportunity for them; but otherwise, they are the Delight of our spare Hours; and we shall read them over and over, as long as we live, with Thankfulness to God, who has given us so virtuous and so discreet a Daughter. How happy is our Lot, in the midst of our Poverty! O let none ever think Children a Burden to them; when the poorest Circumstances can produce so much Riches in a <em class="calibre6">Pamela!</em> Persist, my dear Daughter, in the same excellent Course; and we shall not envy the highest Estate, but defy them to produce such a Daughter as ours.</p>
<p class="indent">‘I said, we had not read thro’ all yours in Course. We were too impatient, and so turn’d to the End; where we find your Virtue within View of its Reward, and your Master’s Heart turn’d to see the Folly of his Ways, and the Injury he had intended to our dear Child. <a id="page_160"></a>For, to be sure, my Dear, he would have ruin’d you, if he could. But seeing your Virtue, God has touched his Heart; and he has, no doubt, been edified by your good Example.</p>
<p class="indent">‘We don’t see that you can do any way so well, as to come into the present Proposal, and make Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, the worthy Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, God bless him!—happy. And tho’ we are poor, and can add no Merit, no Reputation, no Fortune to our dear Child, but rather must be a Disgrace to her, as the World will think; yet I hope I do not sin in my Pride, to say, that there is no good Man, of a common Degree (especially as your late Lady’s Kindness gave you such good Opportunities, which, by God’s Grace, you have so well improv’d) but may think himself happy in you. But, as you say, you had rather <em class="calibre6">not</em> marry at present, far be it from us to offer Violence to your Inclinations. So much Prudence as you have shewn in all your Conduct, would make it very wrong in us to mistrust it in this, or to offer to direct you in your Choice. But, alas! my Child, what can we do for you?—To partake our hard Lot, and involve yourself into as hard a Life, would not help us; but add to our Afflictions. But it is time enough to talk of these things, when we have the Pleasure you now put us in Hope of, of seeing you with us; which God grant. <em class="calibre6">Amen, Amen</em>, say</p>
<div class="blockquote2">
<p class="right">‘<em class="calibre6">Your most indulgent Parents</em>, Amen!</p>
<p class="hangingpara">‘Our humblest Service and Thanks to the worthy Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>. Again, we say, God bless him for ever!</p>
<p class="hangingpara">‘O what a deal have we to say to you! God give us a happy Meeting! We understand the ’Squire is setting out for <em class="calibre6">London</em>. He is a fine Gentleman, and has Wit at Will. I wish he was as good. But I hope he will now reform.’<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">O what inexpressible Comfort, my dear Father, has your Letter given me. You ask, What can you do for me!—What is it you cannot do for your Child!—You can give her the Advice she has so much wanted, and still wants, and will always want; you can confirm her in the Paths of Virtue, into which you first initiated her; and you can pray for her, with Hearts so sincere and pure, that are not to be met with in Palaces!—Oh! how I long to throw myself at your Feet, and receive, from your own Lips, the Blessings of such good Parents!—But, alas! how are my Prospects again over-clouded to what they were when I closed my last Parcel!—More Trials, more Dangers, I fear, must your poor <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> be engaged in: But thro’ God’s <a id="page_161"></a>Goodness, and your Prayers, I hope, at last, to get well out of all my Difficulties; and the rather, as they are not the Effect of my own Vanity or Presumption!</p>
<p class="indent">But I will proceed with my hopeless Story. I saw Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> was a little nettled at my Impatience; and so I wrote to assure him I would be as easy as I could, and directed by him; especially as my Father, whose Respects I mentioned, had assured me, my Master was setting out for <em class="calibre6">London</em>; which he must have some-how from his own Family, or he would not have written me word of it.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">SATURDAY, SUNDAY</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">MR. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> has been here both these Days, as usual; but is very indifferently received still by Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>; and, to avoid Suspicion, I left them together, and went up to my Closet, most of the Time he was here. He and she, I found by her, had a Quarrel; and she seems quite out of Humour with him; but I thought it best not to say any thing. And he said, he would very little trouble the House, till he had an Answer to his Letter from the ’Squire. And she return’d, The less, the better. Poor Man! he has got but little by his Openness, and making Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> his Confident, as she bragged, and would have had me to do likewise. I am more and more satisfied there is Mischief brewing, and shall begin to hide my Papers, and be circumspect. She seems mighty impatient for an Answer to her Letter to my Master.</p>
