<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">SUNDAY</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">THIS blessed Day all the Family seem’d to take Delight to equip themselves for the Celebration of the Sabbath, in the little Chapel; and Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em> and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> came in her Chariot, and the two Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnfords</em>, in their own; with each a Footman, besides the Coachman. And we breakfasted together, in a most agreeable manner. My dear Father appeared quite spruce and neat, and was greatly caressed by the three Ladies. As we were at Breakfast, my Master told Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, we must let the Psalms alone, he doubted, for want of a Clerk; but Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> said, No, nothing should be wanting that he could supply. My Father said, If it might be permitted him, he would, as well as he was able, perform that Office; for it was always what he had taken Delight in. And as I know he had learnt Psalmody formerly, in his Youth, and had constantly practised it in private, at home, of <em class="calibre6">Sunday</em> Evenings, (as well as endeavour’d to teach it in the little School he so unsuccessfully set up, at the Beginning of his Misfortunes, before he took to hard Labour) I was in no Pain for his undertaking it in this little Congregation. They seemed much pleased with this; and so we went to Chapel, and made a pretty tolerable Appearance; Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, and all the Servants attending, but the Cook; and I never saw Divine Service perform’d with more Solemnity, nor assisted at with greater Devotion and Decency; my Master, Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em>, and the two Misses, setting a lovely Example.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_314"></a>My good Father perform’d his Part with great Applause, making the Responses as if he had been a practised Parish Clerk; and giving the<sup class="calibre11">1</sup> xxiii<sup class="calibre11">d</sup> Psalm, which consisting of but three Staves, we had it all; and he read the Line, and began the Tune with a Heart so intirely affected with the Duty, that he went thro’ it distinctly, calmly, and fervently at the same time; so that Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em> whisper’d me, That good Men were fit for all Companies, and present to every laudable Occasion: And Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em> said, God bless the dear good Man!—You must think how I rejoiced in my Mind!</p>
<p class="indent">I know, my dear Mother, you can say most of the shorter Psalms by Heart; so I need not transcribe it, especially as your chief Treasure is a Bible; and a worthy Treasure it is. I know nobody makes more or better Use of it.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> gave us an excellent Discourse on Liberality and Generosity, and the Blessing attending the right Use of Riches, from the xi<sup class="calibre11">th</sup> Chapter of <em class="calibre6">Proverbs</em>, ver. 24, 25. <em class="calibre6">There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet; but it tendeth to Poverty. The liberal Soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth, shall be watered also himself</em>. And he treated the Subject in <a id="page_315"></a>so handsome a manner, that my Master’s Delicacy, who, at first, was afraid of some personal Compliments, was not offended, he judiciously keeping to Generals; and it was an elegant and sensible Discourse, as my Master said.</p>
<p class="poem"><sup class="calibre11">1</sup> <em class="calibre6">THE Lord is only my Support,<br class="calibre3"/>    And he that doth me feed</em>:<br class="calibre3"/><em class="calibre6">How can I then tack any thing,<br class="calibre3"/>    Whereof I stand in need?<br class="calibre3"/>In Pastures green he feedeth me,<br class="calibre3"/>    Where I do safely lie;<br class="calibre3"/>And after leads me to the Streams,<br class="calibre3"/>    Which run most pleasantly</em>.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">And when I find myself near lost,<br class="calibre3"/>    Then home he doth me take;<br class="calibre3"/>Conducting me in his right Path,<br class="calibre3"/>    E’en for his own Name’s sake</em>.<br class="calibre3"/><em class="calibre6">And tho’ I mere e ’en at Death’s Door,<br class="calibre3"/>    Yet mould I fear no Ill</em>:<br class="calibre3"/><em class="calibre6">For both thy Rod, and Shepherd’s Crook,<br class="calibre3"/>    Afford me Comfort still</em>.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">Thou hast my Table richly spread</em><br class="calibre3"/>    <em class="calibre6">In Presence of my Foe</em>.<br class="calibre3"/><em class="calibre6">Thou hast my Head mith Balm refresh’d;</em><br class="calibre3"/>    <em class="calibre6">My Cup doth overflow</em>.<br class="calibre3"/><em class="calibre6">And finally, while Breath doth last,<br class="calibre3"/>    Thy Grace shall me defend</em>:<br class="calibre3"/><em class="calibre6">And in the House of God will I</em><br class="calibre3"/>    <em class="calibre6">My Life for ever spend</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">My Father was, as in the Clerk’s Place, just under the Desk; and Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em> beckon’d her Footman, and whisper’d him to beg him to favour us with another Psalm, when the Sermon was ended, he, thinking as he said afterwards, that the former was rather of the longest, chose the shortest in the Book; which, you know, is the cxvii<sup class="calibre11">th</sup>.<sup class="calibre11">1</sup></p>
<p class="indent">My Master thanked Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> for his excellent Discourse, and so did the Ladies; as also I did, most heartily, and he was pleased to take my dear Father by the Hand, as Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> also did, and thanked him. The Ladies also made him their kind Compliments; and the Servants all looked upon him with Countenances of Respect and Pleasure.</p>
<p class="indent">At Dinner, do what I could, I was forced to take the Upper-end of the Table; and my Master sat at the Lower-end, between Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> and my Father. And he said, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, you are so dextrous, that I think you may help the Ladies yourself; and I will help my two good Friends. I should have told you tho’, that I dressed myself in a flower’d Satten, that was my Lady’s, and look’d quite fresh and good, and which was given me at first by my Master; and the Ladies, who had not seen me out of my Homespun before, made me abundance of fine Compliments, as soon as they saw me first.</p>
<p class="indent">Talking of the Psalms, just after Dinner, my Master was very naughty, if I may so say: For he said to my Father, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Andrews</em>, I think, in the Afternoon, as we shall have only Prayers, we may have one longer Psalm; and what think you of the cxxxvii<sup class="calibre11">th</sup>?—O good Sir! said I, pray, pray, not a Word more!—Say what you will, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said he, you shall sing it to us, according to your own Version, before <a id="page_316"></a>these good Ladies go away. My Father smil’d, but was half concern’d for me; and said, Will it bear, and please your Honour?—O ay, said he, never fear it; so long as Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> is not in the Hearing.</p>
<p class="poem"><sup class="calibre11">1</sup> <em class="calibre6">O All ye Nations of the World,<br class="calibre3"/>    Praise ye the Lord always</em>:<br class="calibre3"/><em class="calibre6">And all ye People ev ’ry-where<br class="calibre3"/>    Set forth his noble Praise.<br class="calibre3"/>For great his Kindness is to us;<br class="calibre3"/>    His Truth doth not decay:<br class="calibre3"/>Wherefore praise ye the Lord our God;<br class="calibre3"/>    Praise ye the Lord alway</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">This excited all the Ladies Curiosity; and Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em> said, She should be loth to desire to hear any thing that would concern me; but should be glad I would give Leave for it. Indeed, Madam, said I, I must beg you won’t insist upon it. I cannot bear it.—You shall see it indeed, Ladies, said my Master; and pray, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, not always as you please, neither.—Then, pray, Sir, said I, not in my hearing, I hope.—Sure, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, return’d he, you would not write what is not fit to be heard!—But, Sir, said I, there are particular Cases, Times, and Occasions, that may make a thing passable at one time, that would not be tolerable at another. O, said he, let me judge of that, as well as you, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>. These Ladies know a good Part of your Story; and, let me tell you, what they know is more to your Credit than mine; so that if I have no Averseness to reviving the Occasion, you may very well bear it. Said he, I will put you out of your Pain, <em class="calibre6">Pamela;</em> I believe I put it in my Pocket on purpose.</p>
<p class="indent">I stood up, and said, Indeed, Sir, I can’t bear it! I hope you’ll allow me to leave the Room a Minute, if you will read it. Indeed, but I won’t, answer’d he. Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em> said, Pray, good Sir, don’t let us hear it, if Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Andrews</em> be so unwilling. Well, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said my Master, I will put it to your Choice, whether I shall read it now, or you will sing it by-and-by. That’s very hard, Sir, said I. It must be one, I assure you, said he. Why then, Sir, reply’d I, you must do as you please; for I cannot sing it.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, then, said my Master, I find I must read it; and yet, added he, after all, I had as well let it alone; for it is no great Reputation to myself. O then, said Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em>, pray let us hear it to chuse.</p>
<p class="indent">Why then, proceeded he, the Case was this: <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, I find, when she was in the Time of her Confinement, (that is, added he, when she was taken Prisoner, in order to make me one; for that is the Upshot of the Matter) in the Journal she kept, which was intended for nobody’s Perusal but her Parents, tells them, That she was importuned, one <em class="calibre6">Sunday</em>, by Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, to sing a Psalm; but her Spirits not permitting, she declin’d it: But after Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> was gone down, she says, she recollected, that the cxxxvii<sup class="calibre11">th</sup> Psalm was applicable to her own Case; Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> having often, on other Days, in vain, besought her to sing a Song. That thereupon she turn’d it <a id="page_317"></a>more to her own supposed Case; and believing Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> had a Design against her Honour, and looking upon her as her Gaoler, she thus gives her Version of this Psalm. But pray, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, do you read one Verse of the common Translation,<a id="exp-note_77"></a><a href="part0021_split_077.html#exp-note-77" class="nounder">*</a> and I will read one of <em class="calibre6">Pamela’s</em>. Then Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> pulling out his little Pocket Common-prayer Book, read the first two Stanzas.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="center1">I</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">WHEN we did sit in</em> Babylon,<br class="calibre3"/>    <em class="calibre6">The Rivers round about:<br class="calibre3"/>Then in Remembrance of</em> Sion,<br class="calibre3"/>    <em class="calibre6">The Tears for Grief burst out</em>.</p>
<p class="center1">II.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">We hang’d our Harps and Instruments<br class="calibre3"/>    The Willow-trees upon:<br class="calibre3"/>For in that Place Men, for that Use,<br class="calibre3"/>    Had planted many a one</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">My Master then read:</p>
<p class="center1">I.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">WHEN sad I sat in</em> B——n-hall,<br class="calibre3"/>    <em class="calibre6">All watched round about;<br class="calibre3"/>And thought of every absent Friend,<br class="calibre3"/>    The Tears for Grief burst out</em>.</p>
<p class="center1">II.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">My Joys, and Hopes, all overthrown,<br class="calibre3"/>    My Heart-strings almost broke:<br class="calibre3"/>Unfit my Mind for Melody,<br class="calibre3"/>    Much more to bear a Joke</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">The Ladies said, It was very pretty; and Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em>, That somebody else had well observ’d, that I had need to be less concerned than themselves.</p>
<p class="indent">I knew, said my Master, I should get no Credit by shewing this. But let us read on, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>. So Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> read;<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="center1"><a id="page_318"></a>III.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">Then they, to whom we Pris’ners were,<br class="calibre3"/>    Said to us tauntingly;<br class="calibre3"/>Now let us hear your</em> Hebrew <em class="calibre6">Songs,<br class="calibre3"/>    And pleasant Melody</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Now this, said my Master, is very near: And read;<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="center1">III.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">Then she, to whom I Pris’ner was,<br class="calibre3"/>    Said to me tauntingly;<br class="calibre3"/>Now chear your Heart, and sing a Song,<br class="calibre3"/>    And tune your Mind to Joy</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Mighty sweet, said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>. But let us see how the next Verse is turn’d. It is this:<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="center1">IV.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">Alas! said we, who can once frame<br class="calibre3"/>    His heavy Heart to sing<br class="calibre3"/>The Praises of our loving God,<br class="calibre3"/>    Thus under a strange King?</em></p>
<p class="indent">Why, said my Master, it is turn’d with beautiful Simplicity, thus:<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="center1">IV.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">Alas! said I, how can I frame<br class="calibre3"/>    My heavy Heart to sing,<br class="calibre3"/>Or tune my Mind, while thus inthrall’d<br class="calibre3"/>    By such a wicked Thing!</em></p>
<p class="indent">Very pretty, said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>. Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em> said, O dear, Madam, can you wish that we should be depriv’d of this new Instance of your Genius and Accomplishments?</p>
<p class="indent">O! said my dear Father, you will make my good Child proud. No, said my Master, very generously, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> can’t be proud. For no one is proud to hear themselves prais’d, but those who are not us’d to it.</p>
<p class="indent">—But proceed, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>. He read;<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="center1"><a id="page_319"></a>V.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">But yet, if I</em> Jerusalem<br class="calibre3"/>    <em class="calibre6">Out of my Heart let slide;<br class="calibre3"/>Then let my Fingers quite forget<br class="calibre3"/>    The warbling Harp to guide</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, now, said my Master, for <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>’s Version!<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="center1">V.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">But yet, if from my Innocence<br class="calibre3"/>    I, ev’n in Thought, should slide;<br class="calibre3"/>Then let my Fingers quite forget<br class="calibre3"/>    The sweet Spinnet to guide</em>.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> read;</p>
<p class="center1">VI.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">And let my Tongue within my Mouth,<br class="calibre3"/>    Be ty’d for ever fast,<br class="calibre3"/>If I rejoice before I see<br class="calibre3"/>    Thy full Deliv’rance past</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">This also, said my Master, is very near.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="center1">VI.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">And let my Tongue, within my Mouth,<br class="calibre3"/>    Be lock’d for ever fast,<br class="calibre3"/>If I rejoice before I see<br class="calibre3"/>    My full Deliv’rance past</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, good Sir, said I, oblige me; don’t read any further: Pray don’t! O pray, Madam, said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, let me beg to have the rest read; for I long to know who you make the Sons of <em class="calibre6">Edom</em>, and how you turn the Psalmist’s Execrations against the insulting <em class="calibre6">Babylonians.<a id="exp-note_78"></a><a href="part0021_split_078.html#exp-note-78" class="nounder">*</a></em></p>
<p class="indent">Well, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, reply’d I, you should not have said so. O, said my Master, that is one of the best things of all. Poor Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> stands for <em class="calibre6">Edom</em>’s Sons; and we must not lose this, because I think it one of my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>’s Excellencies, that tho’ thus oppress’d, she prays for no Harm upon the Oppressor. Read, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, the next Stanza. So he read;<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="center1"><a id="page_320"></a>VII.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">Therefore, O Lord, remember now<br class="calibre3"/>   The cursed Noise and Cry,<br class="calibre3"/>That</em> Edom’<em class="calibre6">s Sons against us made,<br class="calibre3"/>   When they rais’d our City</em>.</p>
<p class="center1">VIII.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">Remember, Lord, their cruel Words,<br class="calibre3"/>   When, with a mighty Sound,<br class="calibre3"/>They cried, Down, yea, down with it,<br class="calibre3"/>   Unto the very Ground</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, said my Master, here seems, in what I am going to read, a little bit of a Curse indeed; but I think it makes no ill Figure in the Comparison.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="center1">VII.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">And thou, Almighty! recompense<br class="calibre3"/>   The Evils I endure,<br class="calibre3"/>From those who seek my sad Disgrace,<br class="calibre3"/>   So causeless! to procure</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">And now, said he, for <em class="calibre6">Edom</em>’s Sons! Tho’ a little severe in the Imputation.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="center1">VIII.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">Remember, Lord, this Mrs</em>. Jewkes,<br class="calibre3"/>   <em class="calibre6">When with a mighty Sound,<br class="calibre3"/>She cries, Down with her Chastity,<br class="calibre3"/>   Down to the very Ground!</em></p>
<p class="indent">Sure, Sir, said I, this might have been spar’d! But the Ladies and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> said, No, by no means! And I see the poor wicked Woman has no Favourers among them.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, said my Master, read the Psalmist’s heavy Curses: And Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> read;<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="center1">IX.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">Ev’n so shalt thou</em>, O Babylon!<br class="calibre3"/>   <em class="calibre6">At length to Dust be brought:<br class="calibre3"/>And happy shall that Man be call’d,<br class="calibre3"/>   That our Revenge hath wrought</em>.</p>
<p class="center1"><a id="page_321"></a>X.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">Yea, blessed shall that Man be call’d,<br class="calibre3"/>   That takes thy little ones,<br class="calibre3"/>And dasheth them in pieces small<br class="calibre3"/>   Against the very Stones</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, said he, very kindly, has <em class="calibre6">my Pamela</em> turn’d these Lines.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="center1">IX.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">Ev’n so shalt thou, O wicked one,<br class="calibre3"/>   At length to Shame be brought:<br class="calibre3"/>And happy shall all those be call’d,<br class="calibre3"/>   That my Deliv’rance wrought</em>.</p>
<p class="center1">X.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">Yea, blessed shall the Man be call’d,<br class="calibre3"/>   That shames thee of thy Evil,<br class="calibre3"/>And saves me from thy vile Attempts,<br class="calibre3"/>   And thee, too, from the D—l</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">I fansy this blessed Man, said my Master, smiling, was, at that time, hoped to be you, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, if the Truth was known. Sir, said he, whoever it was intended for then, it can be nobody but your good Self now.</p>
<p class="indent">I could hardly hold up my Head for the Praises the kind Ladies were pleased to heap upon me. I am sure, by this, they are very partial in my Favour; all because my Master is so good to me, and loves to hear me praised; for I see no such Excellence in these Lines, as they would make me believe, besides what is borrow’d from the <em class="calibre6">Psalmist</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">We all, as before, and the Cook-maid too, attended the Prayers of the Church in the Afternoon; and my dear Father concluded with the following Stanzas of the cxlv<sup class="calibre11">th</sup> Psalm; suitably magnifying the holy Name of God for all his Mercies; but did not observe altogether the Method in which they stand; which was the less necessary, he thought, as he gave out the Lines.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">THE Lord is just in all his ways;<br class="calibre3"/>   His Works are holy all:<br class="calibre3"/>And he is near all those that do<br class="calibre3"/>   In Truth upon him call</em>.</p>
<p class="poem"><a id="page_322"></a><em class="calibre6">He the Desires of all of them<br class="calibre3"/>   That fear him, will fulfil,<br class="calibre3"/>And he will hear them when they cry,<br class="calibre3"/>   And save them all he will</em>.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">The Eyes of all do wait on thee;<br class="calibre3"/>   Thou dost them all relieve:<br class="calibre3"/>And thou to each sufficing Food,<br class="calibre3"/>   In Season due, dost give</em>.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">Thou openest thy plenteous Hand,<br class="calibre3"/>   And bounteously dost fill<br class="calibre3"/>All things whatever that do live,<br class="calibre3"/>   With Gifts of thy Good-will</em>.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">My thankful Mouth shall gladly speak<br class="calibre3"/>   The Praises of the Lord:<br class="calibre3"/>All Flesh to praise his holy Name,<br class="calibre3"/>   For ever shall accord</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">We walked in the Garden till Tea was ready; and as we went by the Back-door, my Master said to me. <em class="calibre6">Of all the Flowers in the Garden, the Sun-flower is the fairest!</em>—O, Sir, said I, let that be now forgot! Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> heard him say so, and seem’d a little out of Countenance: Whereupon my Master said, I mean not to make you serious, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams;</em> but we see how strangely things are brought about. I see other Scenes hereabouts, that, in my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>’s Dangers, give me more Cause of Concern, than any thing you ever did, should give you. Sir, said he, you are very generous.</p>
<p class="indent">My Master and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> afterwards walked together, for a Quarter of an Hour, and talked about general things, and some scholastic Subjects, and joined us, very well pleased with one another’s Conversation.</p>
<p class="indent">Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em> said, putting herself on one side of me, as my Master was of the other, But pray, Sir, when is the happy Time to be? We want it over, that we may have you with us, as long afterwards as you can. Said my Master, I would have it to-morrow or next Day, at farthest, if <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> will: For I have sent for a Licence, and the Messenger will be here to-night, or early in the Morning, I hope. But, added he, pray, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, do not take beyond <em class="calibre6">Thursday</em>. She was pleased to say, Sure it will not be delay’d by you, Madam, more than <a id="page_323"></a>needs!—Well, said he, now <em class="calibre6">you</em> are on my Side, I will leave you with her, to settle it: And, I hope, she will not let little bashful Niceties be important with her; and so he joined the two Misses.</p>
<p class="indent">Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em> told me, I was to blame, she would take upon her to say, if I delay’d it a Moment; because she understood Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> was very uneasy at the Prospect that it would be so; and if any thing should happen, it would be a sad thing!—Madam, said I, when he was pleased to mention it to me first, he said it should be in fourteen Days; and afterwards, ask’d me if I would have it in the first or the second Seven. I answer’d,—for how could I do otherwise? In the second: He desir’d it might not be the last Day of the second Seven. Now, Madam, said I, as he was <em class="calibre6">then</em> pleased to speak his Mind, no doubt, I would not for any thing seem too forward.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, but, said she, as he now urges you in so genteel and gentlemanly a manner for a shorter Day, I think, if I was in your place, I would agree to it. She saw me hesitate and blush, and said, Well, you know best; but I say only what I would do. I said, I would consider of it; and if I saw he was very earnest, to be sure I should think I ought to oblige him.</p>
<p class="indent">Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnfords</em> were begging to be at the Wedding, and to have a Ball: And they said, Pray, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Andrews</em>, second our Requests, and we shall be greatly obliged to you. Indeed, Ladies, said I, I cannot promise that, if I might. Why so? said they.—Because, answer’d I,—I know not what! But, I think, one may, with Pleasure, celebrate an <em class="calibre6">Anniversary</em> of one’s Nuptials; but the <em class="calibre6">Day itself</em>—Indeed, Ladies, I think it is too solemn a Business, for the <em class="calibre6">Parties</em> of our Sex, to be very gay upon! It is a quite serious and awful Affair: And I am sure, in your own Cases, you would be of my Mind. Why then, said Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em>, the more need one has to be as light-hearted and merry as one can.</p>
<p class="indent">I told you, said my Master, what sort of an Answer you’d have from <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>. The younger Miss said, She never heard of such grave Folks in her Life, on such an Occasion! Why, Sir, said she, I hope you’ll sing Psalms all Day, and Miss will fast and pray! Such Sackcloth and Ashes Doings, for a Wedding, did I never hear of!—She spoke a little spitefully, I thought; and I return’d no Answer. I shall have enough to do, I reckon, in a-while, if I am to answer every one that will envy me!</p>
<p class="indent">We went in to Tea, and all the Ladies could prevail upon my <a id="page_324"></a>Master for, was a Dancing-match before he left this Country; but Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em> said, It should then be at their House; for, truly, if she might not be at the Wedding, she would be affronted, and come no more hither, till we had been there.</p>
<p class="indent">When they were gone, my Master would have had my Father stay till the Affair was over; but he begg’d he might set out as soon as it was light in the Morning; for, he said, my Mother would be doubly uneasy at his Stay; and he burned with Impatience, to let her know all the happy things that had befallen her Daughter. When my Master found him so desirous to go, he called Mr. <em class="calibre6">Thomas</em>, and order’d him to get a particular Bay-horse ready betimes in the Morning, for my Father, and a Portmanteau, to put his Things in; and to attend him a Day’s Journey; And if, said he, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Andrews</em> chuses it, see him safe to his own Home. And, added he, as that Horse will serve you, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Andrews</em>, to ride backwards and forwards, to see us when we go to <em class="calibre6">Bedfordshire</em>, I make you a Present of it, with the Accoutrements. And seeing my Father going to speak, he added, I won’t be said Nay. O how good was this!</p>
<p class="indent">He also said a great many kind things at Supper-time, and gave him all the Papers he had of mine; but desir’d, when he and my Mother had read them, that he would return them to him again. And then he said, So affectionate a Father and Daughter may, perhaps, be glad to be alone together; therefore, remember me to your good Wife, and tell her, it will not be long, I hope, before I see you together, on a Visit to your Daughter, at my other House; and so I wish you Good-night, and a good Journey, if you go before I see you; and then he shook Hands, and left my dear Father almost unable to speak, thro’ the Sense of his Favours and Goodness.</p>
<p class="indent">You may believe, my dear Mother, how loth I was to part with my good Father; and he was also unwilling to part with me; but he was so impatient to see you, and tell you the blessed Tidings, with which his Heart overflow’d, that I could hardly wish to detain him.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> brought two Bottles of Cherry-brandy, and two Bottles of Cinamon-water, and some Cake; and they were put up in the Portmanteau, with my Father’s newly presented Cloaths; for he said, he would not, for any thing, be seen in them in his Neighbourhood, till I was actually known, by every body, to be marry’d; nor would he lay out any part of the twenty Guineas till then neither, for fear of Reflections; and then he would consult me as to what he should buy <a id="page_325"></a>Well, said I, as you please, my dear Father; and I hope now we shall often have the Pleasure of hearing from one another, without needing any Art or Contrivances.</p>
<p class="indent">He said, he would go to-bed betimes, that he might be up as soon as it was light; and so he took Leave of me, and said he would not love me, if I got up in the Morning to see him go; which would but make us more loth to part, and grieve us both all Day.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. <em class="calibre6">Thomas</em> brought him a Pair of Boots, and told him, he would call him up at peep of Day, and put up every thing over Night; and so I received his Blessing and his Prayers, and his kind Promises of procuring the same from you, my dear Mother, and went up to my Closet with a heavy Heart, and yet a half pleased one, if I may so say; for that, as he must go, he was going to the best of Wives, and with the best of Tidings. But I begg’d he would not work so hard as he had done; for I was sure my Master would not have given him twenty Guineas for Cloaths, if he had not designed to do something else for him; and that he should be the less concern’d at receiving Benefits from my good Master, because he, who had so many Persons to employ in his large Possessions, could make him serviceable, to an equivalent Degree, without hurting any body else.</p>
<p class="indent">He promised me fair; and pray, dear Mother, see he performs. I hope my Master will not see this. For I will not send it you, at present, till I can send you the best of News; and the rather, as my dear Father can supply the greatest Part of what I have written, since the Papers he carries you, by his own Observation. So, God bless you both! Good-night! And send my Father a safe Journey, and a happy Meeting to you both!</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">MONDAY</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">M. <em class="calibre6">Colbrand</em> being return’d, my Master came up to me to my Closet, and brought me the Licence. O how my Heart flutter’d at the Sight of it! Now, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said he, tell me, If you can oblige me with the Day. Your Word is all that’s wanting! I made bold to kiss his dear Hand; and tho’ unable to look up, said,—I know not what to say, Sir, to all your Goodness! I would not, for any Consideration, that you should believe me capable of receiving negligently an Honour, that all the Duty of a long Life, were it to be lent me, will not be sufficient to enable me to be grateful for. I ought to resign myself, in every <a id="page_326"></a>thing I may or can, implicitly to your Will. But—But what? said he, with a kind Impatience!—Why, Sir, said I, when from last <em class="calibre6">Thursday</em> you mention’d Fourteen Days, I had Reason to think that Term your Choice; and my Heart is so wholly yours, that I am afraid of nothing, but that I may be forwarder than you wish. Impossible, my dear Creature, said he, and folded me in his Arms; impossible! If this be all, it shall be set about this Moment, and this happy Day shall make you mine!—I’ll send away instantly, said the dear Gentleman, and was going.</p>
<p class="indent">I said, No, pray, Sir, pray, Sir, hear me!—Indeed it cannot be today!—Cannot! said he.—No, indeed, Sir! said I.—And was ready to sink to see his generous Impatience! Why flatter’d you then, my fond Heart, said he, with the Hope that it might!—Sir, said I, I will tell you what I had thought, if you’ll vouchsafe me your Attention. Do then, said he!</p>
<p class="indent">I have, Sir, proceeded I, a great Desire, that whenever the Day is, it may be of a <em class="calibre6">Thursday</em>: Of a <em class="calibre6">Thursday</em> my dear Father and Mother were marry’d, and tho’ poor, they are a very happy Pair.—Of a <em class="calibre6">Thursday</em> your poor <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> was born: Of a <em class="calibre6">Thursday</em> my dear good Lady took me from my Parents into her Protection: Of a <em class="calibre6">Thursday</em>, Sir, you caus’d me to be carry’d away to this Place, to which I now, by God’s Goodness and your Favour, owe so amazingly all my present Prospects; and of a <em class="calibre6">Thursday</em> it was, you nam’d to me that Fourteen Days from that, you would confirm my Happiness. Now, Sir, if you please to indulge my superstitious Folly, you will greatly oblige me: I was sorry, Sir, for this Reason, when you bid me not defer till the last Day of the Fourteen, that <em class="calibre6">Thursday</em> in next Week was that last Day.</p>
<p class="indent">This, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, is a little superstitious, I must needs say; and I think you should begin now to make another Day in the Week a happy one; as for Example, On a <em class="calibre6">Monday</em>, may you say, my Father and Mother concluded to be marry’d on the <em class="calibre6">Thursday</em> following. Of a <em class="calibre6">Monday</em>, so many Years ago, my Mother was preparing all her Matters, to be brought to-bed on the <em class="calibre6">Thursday</em> following. Of a <em class="calibre6">Monday</em>, several Weeks ago, it was that you had but two Days more to stay, till you was carry’d away on <em class="calibre6">Thursday</em>. On a <em class="calibre6">Monday</em>, I myself, said he, well remember, it was, that I wrote you the Letter, that prevail’d on you so kindly to return to me; and, on the same Day, you <em class="calibre6">did</em> return to my House here; which I hope, my Girl, will be as propitious an Ærd as any you have nam’d: And now, lastly, will you say, which will crown <a id="page_327"></a>the Work; And, on a <em class="calibre6">Monday</em> I was marry’d.—Come, come, my Dear, added he, <em class="calibre6">Thursday</em> has reign’d long enough o’ Conscience; let us now set <em class="calibre6">Monday</em> in its Place, or at least on an Equality with it, since you see it has a very good Title, and as we now stand in the Week before us, claims Priority; and then, I hope, we shall make <em class="calibre6">Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday</em> and <em class="calibre6">Sunday</em>, as happy Days, as <em class="calibre6">Monday</em> and <em class="calibre6">Thursday;</em> and so, by God’s Blessing, move round as the Days move, in a delightful Circle, till we are at a Loss what Day to prefer to the rest.</p>
<p class="indent">O how charmingly was this said!—And how sweetly kind!</p>
<p class="indent">Indeed, Sir, said I, you rally my Folly very agreeably; but don’t let a little Matter stand in the way, when you are so generously obliging in greater! Indeed I like <em class="calibre6">Thursday</em> best, if I may chuse.</p>
<p class="indent">Well then, said he, if you can say, you have a better Reason than this, I will oblige you; else I’ll send away for the Parson this Moment!</p>
<p class="indent">And so, I protest, he was going!—Dear Sirs, how I trembled!—Stay, stay, Sir, said I: We have a great deal to say first; I have a deal of silly Prate to trouble you with!—Well, say then, in a Minute, reply’d he, the most material; for all we have to say may be talk’d of while the Parson is coming!—O but indeed, and indeed, said I, it cannot be today!—Well then, shall it be to-morrow? said he.—Why, Sir, if it must not be of a <em class="calibre6">Thursday</em>, you have given so many pleasant Distinctions for a <em class="calibre6">Monday</em>, that let it then be next <em class="calibre6">Monday!</em>—What! a Week still? said he. Sir, answer’d I, if you please; for <em class="calibre6">that</em> will be, as you injoin’d, within the second Seven Days. Why, Girl, said he, ’twill be Seven Months till next <em class="calibre6">Monday</em>. Let it, said he, if not to-morrow, be on <em class="calibre6">Wednesday;</em> I protest I will stay no longer.</p>
<p class="indent">Then, Sir, return’d I, please to defer it, however, for one Day more, and it will be my beloved <em class="calibre6">Thursday!</em> If I consent to defer it till then, may I hope, my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said he, that next <em class="calibre6">Thursday</em> shall certainly be the happy Day?—<em class="calibre6">Yes, Sir</em>, said I; and I am sure I look’d very foolishly!</p>
<p class="indent">And yet, my dear Father and Mother, why should I, with such a fine Gentleman! And whom I so dearly love! And so much to my Honour too? But there is something greatly awful upon my Mind, in the solemn Circumstance, and a Change of Condition never to be recall’d, tho’ all the Prospects are so desirable. And I can but wonder, at the thoughtless Precipitancy with which most young Folks run into this important Change of Life!</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_328"></a>So now, my dear Parents, have I been brought to fix so near a Day as next <em class="calibre6">Thursday;</em> and this is <em class="calibre6">Monday</em>. O dear, it makes one out of Breath almost to think of it. This, tho’, was a great Cut-off; a whole Week out of ten Days. I hope I am not too forward! I’m sure, if it obliges my dear Master, I am justify’d; for he deserves all things of me, in my poor Power.</p>
<p class="indent">After this, he rode out on Horse-back, attended by <em class="calibre6">Abraham</em>, and did not return till Night. How by degrees, Things steal upon one! I thought even this small Absence tedious, and the more as we expected him home to Dinner.—I wish I may not be too fond, and make him indifferent: But yet, my dear Father and Mother, you were always fond of one another, and never indifferent, let the World run as it would.—</p>
<p class="indent">When he returned, he said, he had had a pleasant Ride, and was led out to a greater Distance than he intended. At Supper he told me, that he had a great mind Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> should marry us; because, he said, it should shew a thorough Reconciliation of his Part: But, said he, most generously, I am apprehensive on what passed between you, that the poor Man will take it hardly, and as a sort of Insult, which I am not capable of. What says my Girl?—Do you think he would? I hope not, Sir, said I: For, as to what he may think, I can’t answer; but as to any Reason for his Thoughts, I could. But indeed, Sir, said I, you have been already so generous, that he cannot, I think, mistake your Goodness.</p>
<p class="indent">He then spoke with some Resentment of Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>’s Behaviour, and I ask’d, If any thing new had occurr’d? Yes, said he; I have had a Letter deliver’d me from her impertinent Husband, professedly at her Instigation, that amounted to little less than a Piece of insolent Bravery, on supposing I was about to marry you. I was so provok’d, added he, that after I had read it, I tore it into a hundred Pieces, and scatter’d them in the Air, and bid the Man who brought it, let his Master know what I had done with his Letter; and so would not permit him to speak to me, as he would fain have done.—I think the Fellow talk’d somewhat of his Lady coming hither; but she shall not set her Foot within my Doors; and I suppose this Treatment will hinder her.</p>
<p class="indent">I was much concern’d at this: And he said, Had I an hundred Sisters, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, their Opposition should have no Weight with me; and I did not intend you should know it; but you can’t but expect a <a id="page_329"></a>little Difficulty from the Pride of my Sister, who have suffer’d so much from that of her Brother; and we are too nearly ally’d in Mind as well as Blood, I find.—But this is not her Business. And if she would have made it so, she should have done it with more <em class="calibre6">Decency</em>. Little Occasion had <em class="calibre6">she</em> to boast of her Birth, that knows not what belongs to good Manners.</p>
<p class="indent">I said, I am very sorry, Sir, to be the unhappy Occasion of a Misunderstanding between so good a Brother, and so worthy a Sister. Don’t say so, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, because this is an indispensable Consequence of the happy Prospect before us. Only, bear it well yourself, because she is my Sister, and leave it to me to make her sensible of her own Rashness.</p>
<p class="indent">If, Sir, said I, the most lowly Behaviour, and humble Deportment, and in every thing shewing a dutiful Regard to good Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>, will have any Weight with her Ladyship, assure yourself of all in my Power to mollify her. No, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, return’d he, don’t imagine, when you are my Wife, I will suffer you to do any thing unworthy of that Character. I know the Duty of a Husband, and will protect your Gentleness to the utmost, as if you were a Princess by Descent.</p>
<p class="indent">You are inexpressibly good, Sir, said I; but I am far from taking a gentle Disposition, to shew a Meanness of Spirit: And this is a Trial I ought to expect; and well I may bear it, that have so many Benefits to set against it, which all spring from the same Cause.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, said he, all the Matter shall be this: We will talk of our Marriage as a Thing to be done next Week. I find I have Spies upon me where-ever I go, and whatever I do. But now, I am on <em class="calibre6">so</em> laudable a Pursuit, that I value them not, nor their Employers. I have already order’d my Servants to communicate with nobody for ten or twelve Days to come. And Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> tells me, every one names <em class="calibre6">Thursday</em> come Sev’nnight for our Nuptials. So I will get Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em>, who wants to see my little Chapel, to assist Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, under the Notion of breakfasting with me, next <em class="calibre6">Thursday</em> Morning, since you won’t have it sooner; and there will want nobody else; and I will beg of Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em> to keep it private, even from his own Family, for a few Days. Has my Girl any Objection?</p>
<p class="indent">O Sir, answer’d I, you are so generous in all your Ways, I can have no Objections!—But I hope Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> and you will not proceed to irreconcileable Lengths; and when her Ladyship comes to see you, and to tarry with you, two or three Weeks, as she us’d to do, I will <a id="page_330"></a>keep close up, so as not to disgust her with my Sight. Well, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said he, we will talk of that afterwards. You must do then as I shall think fit: And I shall be able to judge what both you and I ought to do. But what still aggravates the Matter is, that she should instigate the titled Ape her Husband to write to me, after she had so little succeeded herself. I wish I had kept his Letter, that I might shew you how a Man that <em class="calibre6">acts</em> generally like a Fool, can take upon him to <em class="calibre6">write</em> like a Lord. But, I suppose it is of my Sister’s Penning, and he, poor Man, is the humble Copier.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">TUESDAY</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">MR. <em class="calibre6">Thomas</em> is return’d from you, my dear Father, with the good News of your Health, and continuing your Journey to my dear Mother, where I hope to hear soon you are arriv’d. My Master has just now been making me play upon the Spinnet, and singing to it; and was pleas’d to commend me for both. But he does so for every thing I do, so partial does his Goodness make him to me.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">One o’Clock</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">WE are just return’d from an Airing in the Chariot; and I have been delighted with his Conversation upon <em class="calibre6">English</em> Authors, Poets particularly. He entertain’d me also with a Description of some of the Curiosities he had seen in <em class="calibre6">Italy</em> and <em class="calibre6">France</em>, when he made what the polite World call the grand Tour. He said, he wanted to be at his other Seat; for he knew not well how to employ himself here, having not purpos’d to stay half the Time: And when I get there, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said he, you will hardly be troubled with so much of my Company, after we are settled; for I have a great many things to adjust; and I must go to <em class="calibre6">London</em>: For I have Accounts that have run longer than ordinary with my Banker there. And I don’t know, added he, but the ensuing Winter, I may give you a little Taste of the Diversions of the Town for a Month or so. I said, his Will and Pleasure should determine mine; and I never would, as near as I could, have a Desire after those, or any other Things that were not in his own Choice.</p>
<p class="indent">He was pleas’d to say, I make no doubt I shall be very happy in you; and hope you will be so in me: For, said he, I have no very enormous Vices to gratify; tho’ I pretend not to the greatest Purity neither, my Girl. Sir, said I, if you can account to your own Mind, I <a id="page_331"></a>shall always be easy in whatever you do. But our greatest Happiness here, Sir, continued I, is of very short Duration; and this Life, where longest, is a poor transitory Stage; and I hope we shall be so happy as to be enabled to look forward, with Comfort, to one other, where our Pleasures will be everlasting.</p>
<p class="indent">You say well, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, and I shall, by degrees, be more habituated to this way of thinking, as I more and more converse with you; but at present, you must not be over serious with me, all at once. Tho’ I charge you, never forbear to mingle your sweet Divinity in our Conversation, whenever it can be brought in <em class="calibre6">à-propos</em>, and with such a Chearfulness of Temper, as shall not throw a gloomy Cloud over our innocent Enjoyments.</p>
<p class="indent">I was abash’d at this, and silent, fearing I had offended; but he said, If you attend rightly to what I said, I need not tell you again, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, not to be discourag’d from suggesting to me, on every proper Occasion, the pious Impulses of your own amiable Mind. Sir, said I, you will be always indulgent, I make no doubt, to my Imperfections, so long as I mean well.</p>
<p class="indent">My Master made me dine with him, and would eat nothing but what I help’d him to; and my Heart is, every Hour, more and more inlarg’d with his Goodness and Condescension. But still, what ails me, I wonder! a strange sort of Weight hangs upon my Mind, as <em class="calibre6">Thursday</em> draws on, which makes me often sigh involuntarily, and damps, at times, the Pleasures of my delightful Prospects!—I hope this is not ominous; but only the foolish Weakness of an over-thoughtful Mind, on an Occasion the most solemn and important of one’s Life, next to the last Scene, which shuts up all.</p>
<p class="indent">I could be very serious! But I will commit all my Ways to that blessed Providence, which hitherto has so wonderfully conducted me, thro’ real Evils, to this hopeful Situation.</p>
<p class="indent">I only fear, and, sure, I have great Reason, that I shall be too unworthy, to hold the Affections of so dear a Gentleman!—God teach me Humility, and to know my own Demerit! And this will be, next to his Grace, my surest Guard, in the State of Life to which I am most unworthily going to be exalted. And don’t cease your Prayers for me, my dear Parents; for, perhaps, this new Condition may be subject to still worse Hazards than those I have escap’d; as would be the Case, were Conceitedness, Vanity, and Pride, to take hold of my frail Heart! and if I was, for my Sins, to be left to my own <a id="page_332"></a>Conduct, a frail Ship in a tempestuous Ocean, without Ballast, or other Pilot than my own inconsiderate Will. But my Master said, on another Occasion, that those who doubted most, always erred least; and, I hope, I shall always doubt my own Strength, my own Worthiness!</p>
<p class="indent">I will not trouble you with twenty sweet agreeable things, that pass’d in Conversation with my excellent Benefactor; nor with the Civilities of Mr. <em class="calibre6">Colbrand</em>, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, and all the Servants, who seem to be highly pleas’d with me, and with my Conduct to them: And, as my Master, hitherto, finds no Fault that I go too low, nor they that I carry it too high, I hope I shall continue to have every body’s Good-will. But yet, will I not seek to gain any one’s by little Meannesses or Debasements; but aim at an uniform and regular Conduct, willing to conceal <em class="calibre6">involuntary</em> Errors, as I would have my own forgiven, and not too industrious to discover <em class="calibre6">real</em> ones, or to hide such, if any such should appear, as might encourage bad Hearts, or unclean Hands, in material Cases, where my Master should receive Damage, or where the Morals of the Transgressors should appear wilfully and habitually corrupt. In short, I will endeavour, as much as I can, that a good Servant shall in me find a kind Encourager; an indifferent one be made better, by inspiring them with a laudable Emulation; and a bad one, if not too bad in Nature, and quite irreclaimable, reform’d by Kindness, Expostulation, and even proper Menaces, if necessary, but most by a good Example. All this, if God pleases.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">WEDNESDAY</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">NOW, my dear Parents, I have but this <em class="calibre6">one</em> Day, between me and the most solemn Rite that can be perform’d. My Heart cannot yet shake off this heavy Weight. Sure I am ingrateful to God’s Goodness, and the Favour of the best of Benefactors!—Yet I hope I am not!—For at times, my Mind is all Exultation, with the Prospect of what Good tomorrow’s happy Solemnity may possibly, by Leave of my generous Master, put it in my Power to do. O how shall I find Words to express, as I ought, my Thankfulness, for all the Mercies before me!—</p>
<h4 class="h3"><a id="page_333"></a><em class="calibre6">WEDNESDAY Evening</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">MY dear Master is all Love and Tenderness! He sees my Weakness, and he generously pities and comforts me! I begg’d to be excus’d Supper; but he brought me down himself from my Closet; and plac’d me by him, bidding <em class="calibre6">Abraham</em> not wait. I could not eat, and yet I try’d, for fear he should be angry. He kindly forbore to hint any thing of the dreadful, yet delightful to-morrow! and put, now-and-then, a little Bit on my Plate, and guided it to my Mouth. I was concern’d to receive his Goodness with so ill a Grace. Well, said he, if you won’t eat with me, drink at least, with me: I drank two Glasses by his Over-persuasions, and said, I am really asham’d of myself. Why, indeed, said he, my dear Girl, I am not a very dreadful Enemy, I hope! I cannot bear any thing that is the least concerning to you. Oh! Sir, said I, all is owing to the Sense I have of my own Unworthiness!—To be sure, it cannot be any thing else.</p>
<p class="indent">He rung for the Things to be taken away! And then reach’d a Chair, and sat down by me, and put his kind Arms about me, and said the most generous and affecting Things that ever dropt from the Honey-flowing Mouth of Love! All I have not time to repeat. Some I will; and oh! indulge your foolish Daughter, who troubles you with her weak Nonsense; because what she has to say, is so affecting to her; and because, if she went to-bed, instead of scribbling, she cannot sleep.</p>
<p class="indent">This sweet Confusion and Thoughtfulness in my beloved <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said the kind Man, on the near Prospect of our happy Union, when I hope all Doubts are clear’d up, and nothing of Dishonour is apprehended, shew me most abundantly, what a Wretch I was to attempt such Purity with a worse Intention!—No wonder, that one so virtuous, should find herself deserted of Life itself, on a Violence so dreadful to her Honour, and refuge herself in the Shadow of Death.—But now, my dearest <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, that you have seen a Purity on my Side, as nearly imitating your own, as our Sex can shew to yours; and that I have, all the Day long, suppress’d even the least Intimation of the coming Day, that I might not alarm your tender Mind; why all this Concern, why all this affecting, yet sweet Confusion! You have a generous Friend, my dear Girl, in me! a Protector now, not a Violator of your Innocence! Why then, once more I ask, this strange Perplexity, this sweet Confusion?</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_334"></a>O Sir, said I, and hid my Face in his Arms! expect not Reason from a foolish Creature! You should have still indulg’d me in my Closet!—I am ready to beat myself for this ungrateful Return to your Goodness. But I know not what!—I am, to be sure, a silly Creature. O had you but suffer’d me to stay by myself above, I should have made myself asham’d of so culpable a Behaviour!—But Goodness added to Goodness every Moment, and the Sense of my own Unworthiness, quite confound me!</p>
<p class="indent">Now, said the generous Man, will I, tho’ reluctantly, make a Proposal to my sweet Girl.—If I have been too pressing for the Day: If another Day will still be more obliging: If you have Fears that will not then be, you shall say but the Word, and I’ll submit. Yes, tho’ I have, my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, for these three Days past, thought every tedious Hour a Day, till <em class="calibre6">Thursday</em> comes, if you earnestly desire it, I will postpone it. Say, my dear Girl, freely say; but accept not my Proposal, without great Reason; which yet I will not ask for.</p>
<p class="indent">Sir, said I, I can expect nothing but superlative Goodness, I have now been so long us’d to it from you. This is a most generous Instance of it; but, I fear—yes, I fear, it will be but too much the same thing, some Days hence, when the happy, yet, Fool that I am! dreaded Time, shall be equally near!—</p>
<p class="indent">Kind, lovely Charmer, said he, now do I see you are to be trusted with Power, from the generous Use you make of it!—Not one offensive Word, or Look from me, shall wound your nicest Thoughts; but pray try to subdue this Over-scrupulousness and unseasonable Timidity. I persuade myself you will if you can!</p>
<p class="indent">Indeed, Sir, I will, said I; for I am quite asham’d of myself, with all these lovely Prospects before me!—The Honours you do me, the Kindness you shew me! I cannot forgive myself! For oh! if I know the least of this idle foolish Heart of mine, it has not a misgiving Thought of your Goodness, and I should abhor it, if it were capable of the least Affectation.—But, dear good Sir, leave me a little to myself, and I will take myself to severer Task than your Goodness will let <em class="calibre6">you</em> do! And I will present my Heart before you, a worthier Offering to you, than at present its wayward Follies will let it seem to be.—But one thing is, one has no kind Friend of one’s own Sex, to communicate one’s foolish Thoughts to, and to be strengthen’d by their Comfortings!—But I am left to myself, and oh! what a weak silly Thing I am!—</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_335"></a>He kindly withdrew, to give me Time to recollect myself, and in about half an Hour return’d. And then, that he might not begin at once upon the Subject, and say at the same time something agreeable to me, said, Your Father and Mother have had a great deal of Talk by this Time, about you, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>. O, Sir, return’d I, your Goodness has made them quite happy. But I can’t help being concern’d about Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">He said, I am vex’d I did not hear the Footman out; because it runs in my Head, he talk’d somewhat about her coming hither. She will meet with but an indifferent Reception from me, without she comes resolv’d to behave better than she writes.</p>
<p class="indent">Pray, Sir, said I, be pleas’d to bear with my good Lady, for two Reasons. What are they, said he? Why first, Sir, answer’d I, Because she is your Sister, and, to be sure, may very well think, what all the World will, that you have much demean’d yourself in making me happy. And next, Because, if her Ladyship finds you out of Temper with her, it will still aggravate her more against me; and every time that any warm Words you may use between you, come into her Mind, she will disdain me more.</p>
<p class="indent">Don’t concern yourself about it, said he; for we have more proud Ladies than she in our t’other Neighbourhood, who perhaps, have still less Reason to be punctilious about their Descent, and yet will form themselves upon her Example, and say, Why, his own Sister will not forgive him, nor visit him! And so, if I can subdue her Spirit, which is more than her Husband ever could, or indeed any body else, it is a great Point gain’d: And, if she gives me Reason, I’ll try for it, I assure you.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, but my dear Girl, continu’d he, since the Subject is so important, may I not say one Word about to-morrow?—Sir, said I, I hope I shall be less a Fool: I have talk’d as harshly to my Heart, as Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> can do, and the naughty Thing suggests to me a better and more grateful Behaviour.</p>
<p class="indent">He smil’d, and kissing me, said, I took Notice, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, of what you observ’d, that you have none of your own Sex with you: I think it is a little hard upon you; and I should have lik’d you should have had Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnford;</em> but then her Sister must have been ask’d; and I might as well make a publick Wedding; which, you know, would have requir’d Cloaths, and other Preparations. Besides, added he, a foolish Proposal was once made me of that second Sister, who has two or <a id="page_336"></a>three thousand Pounds more than the other, left her by a Godmother, and she can’t help being a little piqu’d; tho’, said he, it was a Proposal they could not expect should succeed; for there is nothing in her Person nor Mind; and her Fortune, as that must have been the only Inducement, would not do by any means; and so I discourag’d it at once.</p>
<p class="indent">I am thinking, Sir, said I, of another mortifying Thing too; That were you to marry a Lady of Birth and Fortune, answerable to your own, all the Eve to the Day, would be taken up in reading, signing and sealing of Settlements, and Portion, and such-like. But now the poor <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> brings you nothing at all! And the very Cloaths she wears, so very low is she, are intirely the Effects of your Bounty, and that of your good Mother! This makes me a little sad!—For, alas! Sir, I am so much oppressed by your Favours, and the Sense of the Obligations I owe you, that I cannot look up with the Confidence that I otherwise should, on this awful Occasion.</p>
<p class="indent">There is, my dear <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said he, where the Power is wanting, as much Generosity in the Will as in the Action. To all that know your Story and your Merit, it will appear, that I cannot recompense you for what I have made you suffer. You have had too many hard Struggles and Exercises; and have nobly overcome; and who shall grudge you the Reward of the hard-bought Victory?—This Affair is so much the Act of my own Will, that I glory in being capable of distinguishing so much Excellence; and my Fortune is the more pleasurable to me, as it gives me Hope that I may make you some Part of Satisfaction for what you have undergone.</p>
<p class="indent">This, Sir, said I, is all Goodness, unmerited on my Side; and makes my Obligations the greater! I can only wish for more Worthiness!—But how poor is it to offer nothing but Words for such generous Deeds!—And to say, I <em class="calibre6">wish!</em>—For what is a Wish, but the ac Knowledg’d want of Power to oblige! And a Demonstration of one’s Poverty, in every thing but <em class="calibre6">Will?</em></p>
<p class="indent">And that, my dear Girl, said he, is every thing! ’Tis All I want! ’Tis All that God himself requires of us; for where there is a <em class="calibre6">Will</em>, the Actions must be govern’d by it, or it cannot be called a Will: But no more of these little Doubts, tho’ they are the natural Impulses of a generous and grateful Heart. I want not to be employ’d in Settlements: That is for those to regard, who make Convenience and Fortune the prime Considerations. I have Possessions ample enough <a id="page_337"></a>for us both; and you deserve to share them with me; and you shall do it, with as little Reserve, as if you had brought me what the World reckons an Equivalent: For, as to my own Opinion, you bring me what is infinitely more valuable, an experienc’d Truth, a well-try’d Virtue, and a Wit and Behaviour more than equal to the Station you will be placed in: To say nothing of this sweet Person, that itself might captivate a Monarch; and of the Meekness of a Temper, and Sweetness of Disposition, which make you superior to all the Women I ever saw.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus kind and soothing, and honourably affectionate was the dear Gentleman, to the unworthy, doubting, yet assured <em class="calibre6">Pamela;</em> and thus patiently did he indulge, and generously pardon, my impertinent Weakness. He offer’d to go himself to Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em>, in the Morning, and reveal the Matter to her, and desire her Secrecy and Presence; but I said, That would disoblige the young Lady <em class="calibre6">Darnfords</em>. No, Sir, said I, I will cast myself upon your generous Kindness; for why should I fear the kind Protector of my Weakness, and the Guide and Director of my future Steps?</p>
<p class="indent">You cannot, said he, forgive Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes;</em> for she must know it; and suffer her to be with you? Yes, Sir, said I, I can: She is very civil to me now: And her former Wickedness I will forgive, for the sake of the happy Fruits that have attended it; and because <em class="calibre6">you</em> mention her.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, said he, I will call her in, if you please!—As you please, Sir, said I. And he rung for her; and when she came in, he said, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, I am going to intrust you with a Secret. Sir, answer’d she, I will be sure to keep it as such. Why, said he, we intend to-morrow, privately as possible, for our Wedding-day; and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em> and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> are to be here, as to Breakfast with me, and to shew Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em> my little Chapel. As soon as the Ceremony is over, we will take a little Airing in the Chariot, as we have done at other times; and so it will not be wonder’d that we are dress’d. And the two Parsons have promis’d Secrecy, and will go home. I believe you can’t well avoid letting one of the Maids into the Secret; but that I leave to you.</p>
<p class="indent">Sir, reply’d she, we all concluded it would be in a few Days; and I doubt it won’t be long a Secret. No, said he, I don’t desire it should; but you know we are not provided for a publick Wedding, and I shall declare it when we go to <em class="calibre6">Bedfordshire</em>, which won’t be long. But the Men, who lie in the Out-houses, need not know it; for, by some means or other, my Sister <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> knows all that passes.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_338"></a>Do you know, Sir, said she, that her Ladyship intends to be down here with you, in a few Days? Her Servant told me so, who brought you the Letter you was angry at. I hope, said he, we shall be set out for t’other House first; and shall be pleased she loses her Labour. Sir, continu’d she, her Ladyship proposes to be here time enough to hinder your Nuptials; which she, as well as we did, takes will be the Latter-end of next Week. Well, said he, let her come; but yet I desire not to see her.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> said to me, Give me Leave, Madam, to wish you all manner of Happiness. But I am afraid I have too well obey’d his Honour, to be forgiven by you. Indeed, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, return’d I, you will be more your own Enemy than I will be. I will look all forward: And shall not presume, so much as by a Whisper, to set my good Master against any one he pleases to approve of. And, as to his old Servants, I shall always value them, and never offer to dictate to his Choice, or influence it by my own Caprices.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, said my Master, you find you have no Cause to apprehend any thing. My <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> is very placable; and as we have both been Sinners together, we must be both included in one Act of Grace.</p>
<p class="indent">Such an Example of Condescension, as I have before me, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, said I, may make you very easy; for I must be highly unworthy, if I did not forego all my little Resentments, if I had any, for the sake of so much Goodness to myself.</p>
<p class="indent">You are very kind, Madam, said she; and you may depend upon it, I will atone for all my Faults, by my future Duty and Respect to you, as well as to my Master.</p>
<p class="indent">That’s well said on both sides, said he; but, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, to assure you that my good Girl here has no Malice, she chuses you to attend her in the Morning, at the Ceremony, and you must keep up her Spirits.—I shall, reply’d she, be very proud of the Honour: But I cannot, Madam, but wonder to see you so very low-spirited, as you have been these two or three Days past, with so much Happiness before you.</p>
<p class="indent">Why, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, answer’d I, there can be but one Reason given; and that is, that I am a sad Fool!—But, indeed, I am not ingrateful neither; nor would I put on a foolish Affectation: But my Heart, at times, sinks within me; I know not why, except at my own Unworthiness, and because the Honour done me is too high for me <a id="page_339"></a>to support myself under, as I should do. It is an Honour, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, added I, I was not born to; and no wonder then, I behave so aukwardly. She made me a fine Compliment upon it, and withdrew, repeating her Promises of Care, Secrecy, <em class="calibre6">&amp;c</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">He parted with me, with infinite Tenderness; and I came up, and set to writing, to amuse my Thoughts, and wrote thus far. And Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> being come up, and it being past Twelve, I will go to-bed; but not one Wink, I fear, shall I get this Night.—I could beat myself for Anger. Sure there is nothing ominous in this strange Folly!—But I suppose all young Maidens are the same, so near so great a Change of Condition, tho’ they carry it off more discreetly than I.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">THURSDAY, Six o’Clock in the Morning</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">I Might as well have not gone to-bed last Night, for what Sleep I had. Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> often was talking to me, and said several things that would have been well enough from any body else of our Sex; but the poor Woman has so little Purity of Heart, that it is all <em class="calibre6">Say</em> from her, and goes no further than my Ears.</p>
<p class="indent">I fancy my Master has not slept much neither; for I heard him up, and walking about his Chamber, ever since Break of Day. To be sure, poor Gentleman, he must have some Concern, as well as I; for here he is going to marry a poor foolish unworthy Girl, brought up on the Charity, as one may say, (at least, Bounty) of his worthy Family! And this foolish Girl must be, to all Intents and Purposes, after Twelve o’clock this Day, as much his Wife, as if he were to marry a Dutchess!—And here he must stand the Shocks of common Reflection; The great ’Squire <em class="calibre6">B</em>. has done finely! he has marry’d his poor Servant <em class="calibre6">Wench!</em> will some say. The Ridicule and rude Jests of his Equals, and Companions too, he must stand: And the Disdain of his Relations, and Indignation of Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>, his lofty Sister!—Dear good Gentleman! he will have enough to do, to be sure!—O how shall I merit all these things at his Hands! I can only do the best I can; and pray to God to reward him, and to resolve to love him with a pure Heart, and serve him with a sincere Obedience. I hope the dear Gentleman will continue to love me for this; for, alas! I have nothing else to offer! But, as I can hardly expect so great a Blessing, if I can be secure from his Contempt, I shall not be unfortunate; and must bear his Indifference, if his rich Friends <a id="page_340"></a>should inspire him with it, and proceed with doing my Duty with Chearfulness.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">Half an Hour past Eight o’Clock</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">MY good dear Master, my kind Friend, my generous Benefactor, my worthy Protector, and, Oh! all the good Words in one, my affectionate Husband, that is so soon to be, (be curbed in, my proud Heart, know thyself, and be conscious of thy Unworthiness!—) has just left me, with the kindest, tenderest Expressions, and gentlest Behaviour that ever blest a happy Maiden. He approached me with a sort of reined-in Rapture. My <em class="calibre6">Pamela!</em> said he, May I just ask after your Employment! Don’t let me chide my dear Girl this Day, however. The two Parsons will be here to Breakfast with us at Nine; and yet you are not a bit dress’d! Why this Absence of Mind, and sweet Irresolution!</p>
<p class="indent">Why, indeed, Sir, said I! I will set about a Reformation this Instant! He saw the Common-prayer Book lying in the Window. I hope, said he, my lovely Maiden has been conning the Lesson she is by-and-by to repeat. Have you not, <em class="calibre6">Pamela?</em> and clasped his Arms about me, and kissed me. Indeed, Sir, said I, I have been reading over the solemn Service?—And what thinks my Fairest, for so he called me, of it?—O Sir, ’tis very awful, and makes one shudder to reflect upon it!—No wonder, said he, it should affect my sweet <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>: I have been looking into it this Morning, and I can’t say, but I think it a solemn, but very suitable Service. But this I tell my dear Love, continu’d he, and again clasped me to him, There is not a Tittle in it, that I cannot joyfully subscribe to: And that, my dear <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, should make you easy, and join chearfully in it with me. I kissed his dear Hand; O my generous, kind Protector, said I, how gracious is it to confirm thus the doubting Mind of your poor Servant! which apprehends nothing so much as her own Unworthiness of the Honour and Blessing that await her!—He was pleased to say, I know well, my dearest Creature, that, according to the Liberties we People of Fortune generally give ourselves, I have promised a great deal, when I say so. But I would not have said it, if, deliberately, I could not with all my Heart. So, banish from your Mind all Doubts and Difficulties; let a generous Confidence in me take place; and let me see it does, by your Chearfulness, in this Day’s solemn Business; and then I will love you for ever!</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_341"></a>May God Almighty, Sir, said I, reward all your Goodness to me!—That is all I can say. But, Oh! how kind it is in you, to supply the want of the Presence and Comfortings of a dear Mother; of a loving Sister, or of the kind Companions of my own Sex, which most Maidens have, to sooth their Anxieties on the so near Approach of so awful a Solemnity!—You, Sir, are All these tender Relations in One to me! Your Condescensions and Kindness shall, if possible, embolden me to look up to you without that sweet Terror, that must confuse poor bashful Maidens, on such an Occasion, when they are surrender’d up to a more doubtful Happiness, and to half strange Men; whose good Faith, and good Usage of them, must be less experienced, and is all involv’d in the dark Bosom of Futurity, and only to be proved by the Event.</p>
<p class="indent">This, my dear <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said he, is most kindly said!—It shews me, that you enter gratefully into my Intention. For I would, by my Conduct, supply all these dear Relations to you; and I voluntarily promise, from my Heart, to you, what I think I could not with such assured Resolutions of Performance, to the highest-born Lady in the Kingdom. For, let me tell my sweet Girl, that, after having been long tost by the boisterous Winds of a more culpable Passion, I have now conquer’d it, and am not so much the Victim of your Love, all charming as you are, as of your Virtue; and therefore I may more boldly promise for myself, having so stable a Foundation for my Affection; which, should this outward Beauty fail, will increase with your Virtue, and shine forth the brighter, as that is more illustriously display’d, by the augmented Opportunities which the Condition you are now entering into, will afford you.—O the dear charming Man! how nobly, and encouragingly kind was all this!</p>
<p class="indent">I could not suitably express myself, and he said, I see my Girl is at a Loss for Words! I doubt not your kind Acceptance of my Declarations. And when I have acted too much the Part of a Libertine formerly, for you to look back without some Anxiety, I ought not, being now happily convicted, to say less.—But why loses my dear Girl her Time? I will now only add, that I hope for many happy Years to make good, by my Conduct, what so willingly flows from my Lips.</p>
<p class="indent">He kissed me again, and said, But, whatever you do, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, be chearful; for else, may-be, of the small Company we shall have, some one, not knowing how to account for your too nice Modesty, may <a id="page_342"></a>think there is <em class="calibre6">some other</em> Person in the World, whose Addresses would be still more agreeable to you.</p>
<p class="indent">This he said with an Air of Sweetness and Pleasantry; but it alarm’d me exceedingly, and made me resolve to appear as calm and chearful as possible. For this was indeed a most affecting Expression, and enough to make me, if any thing can, behave as I ought, and to force my idle Fears to give way to Hopes, so much better grounded.—And I began almost, on this Occasion, to wish Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> were not to marry me, lest I should behave like a Fool; and so be liable to an Imputation, which I should be most unworthy if I deserved.</p>
<p class="indent">So I set about dressing me instantly; and he sent Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> to assist me. But I am never long a Dressing, when I set about it; and my Master has now given me a Hint, that will, for half an Hour more, at least, keep my Spirits in a brisk Circulation. Yet it concerns me a little too, lest he should have any, the least Shadow of a Doubt, that I am not, Mind and Person, intirely his. And so being now ready, and not called to Breakfast, I sat down and writ thus far. I might have mention’d, that I dress’d myself in a rich white Sattin Night-gown, that had been my good Lady’s, and my best Head-cloths, &amp;<em class="calibre6">c</em>. I have got such a Knack of writing, that, when I am by myself, I cannot sit without a Pen in my Hand.—But I am now called to Breakfast. I suppose the Gentleman are come!—Now, Courage, <em class="calibre6">Pamela;</em> Remember thou art upon thy good Behaviour:—Fie upon it! my Heart begins to flutter again!—Foolish Heart! lie still! Never, sure, was any Maiden’s perverse Heart under so little Command as mine!—It gave itself away, at first, without my Leave; it has been, for Weeks, pressing me with its Wishes; and yet now, when it should be happy itself, and make me so, it is throb, throb, throb, like a little Fool; and filling me with such unseasonable Misgivings, as abate the rising Comforts of all my better Prospects!</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">THURSDAY, near Three o-Clock</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">I Thought I should have found no Time nor Heart to write again this Day. But here are three Gentlemen come, unexpectedly, to dine with my Master; and so I shall not appear. He has done all he could, civilly, to send them away; but they will stay, tho’, I believe, he had rather they would not. And so I have nothing to do but to write till I <a id="page_343"></a>go to Dinner myself with Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>: For my Master was not prepared for this Company; and it will be a little latish to-day. So I will begin with my happy Story where I left off.</p>
<p class="indent">When I came down to Breakfast, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em> and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> were both there. And as soon as my Master heard me coming down, he met me at the Door, and led me in with great Tenderness. He had kindly spoke to them, as he told me afterwards, to mention no more of the Matter to me, than needs must. I paid my Respects to them, I believe, a little aukwardly, and was almost out of Breath; but said, I had come down a little too fast.</p>
<p class="indent">When <em class="calibre6">Abraham</em> came in to wait, my Master said, (that the Servants should not mistrust) ’Tis well, Gentlemen, you came as you did: For my good Girl and I were going to take an Airing till Dinnertime. I hope you’ll stay and dine with me. Sir, said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em>, we won’t hinder you; I only came, having a little Time upon my Hands, to see your Chapel; but must be at home at Dinner; and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> will dine with me. Well then, said my Master, we will pursue our Intention, and ride out for an Hour or two, as soon as I have shewed Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em> my little Chapel. Will you, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, after Breakfast, walk with us to it? <em class="calibre6">If—if</em>, said I, and had like to have stammer’d, foolish that I was! <em class="calibre6">if you</em> please, Sir. I could look none of them in the Face! <em class="calibre6">Abraham</em> looking at me; Why, Child, said my Master, you have hardly recover’d your Fright yet: How came your Foot to slip? ’Tis well you did not hurt yourself. Said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em>, improving the Hint, You han’t sprain’d your Ankle, Madam, I hope? No, Sir, said I, I believe not! But ’tis a little <em class="calibre6">painful</em> to me. And so it was; for I meant my Foolishness!—<em class="calibre6">Abraham</em>, said my Master, bid <em class="calibre6">Robin</em> put the Horses to the Coach, instead of the Chariot; and if these Gentlemen <em class="calibre6">will</em> go, we can set them down. No matter, Sir, said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em>, I had as live walk, if Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> chuses it. Well then, said my Master, let it be the Chariot, as I told him.</p>
<p class="indent">I could eat nothing, tho’ I attempted it; and my Hand shook so, I spilled some of my Chocolate, and so put it down again; and they were all very good, and looked another way. My Master said, when <em class="calibre6">Abraham</em> was out, I have a quite plain Ring here, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em>. And I hope the Ceremony will dignify the Ring; and that I shall give my Girl Reason to think it, for that Cause, the most valuable one that can be presented her. Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em> said, he was sure I should set more by it, than the richest Diamond in the World.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_344"></a>I had bid Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> not to dress herself, lest she should give Cause of Mistrust; and she took my Advice.</p>
<p class="indent">When Breakfast was over, my Master said, before <em class="calibre6">Abraham</em>, Well, Gentlemen, we will step into the Chapel; and you must give me your Advice, as to the Alterations I design. I am in the more Haste, because the Survey you are going to take of it, for the Alterations, will take up a little time; and we shall have but a small Space between that and Dinner, for the Tour I design to make.—<em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, you’ll give us your Opinion, won’t you? Yes, Sir, said I; I’ll come after you.</p>
<p class="indent">So they went out, and I sat down in the Chair again, and fanned myself; I am sick at Heart, said I, I think, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>. Said she, Shall I fetch you a little Cordial?—No, said I, I am a sad Fool! I want Spirits, that’s all. She took her Smelling-bottle, and would have given it me; but I said, Keep it in your Hand; may-be, I may want it; but I hope not.</p>
<p class="indent">She gave me very good Words; and begg’d me to go: And I got up, but my Knees beat so against one another, I was forced to sit down again. But, at last, I held by her Arm, and passing by <em class="calibre6">Abraham</em>, I said, This ugly Slip, coming down Stairs, has made me limp, tho’; so I must hold by you. Do you know, said I, what Alterations there are to be in the Chapel, that we must all give our Opinions of them?</p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre6">Nan</em>, she told me, was let into the Secret; and she had order’d her to stay at the Chapel Door, to see that nobody came in. My dear Master came to me, at entering the Chapel, and took my Hand, and led me up to the Altar. Remember, my dear Girl, whisper’d he, and be chearful. I am, I will, Sir, said I; but I hardly knew what I said; and so you may believe, when I said to Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, Don’t leave me; pray, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, don’t leave me; as if I had all Confidence in her, and none where it was most due. So she kept close to me. God forgive me! but I never was so absent in my Life, as at first: Even till Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> had gone on in the Service, so far as to the awful Words about <em class="calibre6">requiring us, as we should answer at the dreadful Day of Judgment;</em> and then the solemn Words,<a id="exp-note_79"></a><a href="part0021_split_079.html#exp-note-79" class="nounder">*</a> and my Master’s whispering, Mind this, my Dear, made me start. Said he, still whispering, Know <em class="calibre6">you</em> any Impediment? I blush’d, and said, softly, None, Sir, but my great Unworthiness.</p>
<p class="indent">Then follow’d the sweet Words, <em class="calibre6">Wilt thou have this Woman to thy wedded Wife</em>, &amp;c. and I began to take Heart a little, when my dearest Master answer’d, audibly, to this Question, <em class="calibre6">I will</em>. But I could only <a id="page_345"></a>make a Curchee, when they asked me; tho’, I am sure, my Heart was readier than my Speech, and answer’d to every Article of <em class="calibre6">obey, serve, love</em> and <em class="calibre6">honour</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em> gave me away, and I said after Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, as well as I could, as my dear Master did, with a much better Grace, the Words of Betrothment; and the Ceremony of the Ring passing next, I received the dear Favour at his worthy Hands, with a most grateful Heart; and he was pleased to say afterwards, in the Chariot, that when he had done saying, <em class="calibre6">With this Ring I thee wed</em>, &amp;c. I made a Curchee, and said, Thank you, Sir. May-be, I did; for, I am sure, it was a most grateful Part of the Service; and my Heart was over-whelm’d with his Goodness, and the tender Grace wherewith he perform’d it. I was very glad, that the next Part was the Prayer, and Kneeling; for I trembled so, I could hardly stand, betwixt Fear and Delight.</p>
<p class="indent">The joining of our Hands afterwards, the Declaration of our being marry’d to the few Witnesses present; for, reckoning <em class="calibre6">Nan</em>, whose Curiosity would not let her stay at the Door, they were but Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em>, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, and she; the Blessing, the Psalm, and the subsequent Prayers, and the concluding Exhortation, were so many beautiful, welcome and lovely Parts of this divine Office, that my Heart began to be delighted with them, and my Spirits to be a little freer.</p>
<p class="indent">And thus, my dearest, dear Parents, is your happy, happy, thrice happy <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, at last, marry’d; and to who?—Why, to her beloved, gracious Master! the Lord of her Wishes!—And thus the dear, once naughty Assailer of her Innocence, by a blessed Turn of Providence, is become the kind, the generous Protector and Rewarder of it. God be evermore blessed and praised! and make me not wholly unworthy of such a transcendent Honour!—And bless and reward the dear, dear good Gentleman, who has thus exalted his unworthy Servant, and given her a Place, which the greatest Ladies would think themselves happy in!</p>
<p class="indent">My Master saluted me most ardently, and said, God give you, my dear Love, as much Joy on this Occasion, as I have. And he presented me to Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em>, who saluted me; and said, You may excuse me, dear Madam; for I gave you away, and you are my Daughter. And Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> modestly withdrawing a little way; Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, said my Master, pray accept my Thanks, and wish your <em class="calibre6">Sister</em> Joy. So he <a id="page_346"></a>saluted me too; and said, Most heartily, Madam, I do. And I will say, that to see so much Innocence and Virtue, so eminently rewarded, is one of the greatest Pleasures I have ever known. This my Master took very kindly.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> would have kissed my Hand at the Chapel Door; but I put my Arms about her Neck, for I had got a new Recruit of Spirits just then, and kissed her; and said, Thank you, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, for accompanying me. I have behav’d sadly. No, Madam, said she, pretty well, pretty well! While the Gentlemen were talking, I dropt down on my Knees in a Corner, and once more blessed God for this so signal a Mercy; and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em> afterwards walked out with me; and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> and my Master talked together, and came out after us.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em>, when we came into the Parlour, said, I once more, Madam, must wish you Joy of this happy Occasion. I wish every Day may add to your Comforts; and may you very long rejoice in one another; for you are the loveliest Couple I ever saw join’d. I told him, I was infinitely oblig’d to his kind Opinion, and good Wishes; and hoped my future Conduct would not make me unworthy of them.</p>
<p class="indent">My good Benefactor came in with Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>: So, my dear Life, said he, How do you do? A little more compos’d, I hope!—Well, you see this is not so dreadful an Affair as you apprehended. Sir, said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em>, very kindly, ’tis a very solemn Circumstance, and I love to see it so reverently and awfully enter’d upon. It is a most excellent Sign; for the most thoughtful Beginnings make the most prudent Proceedings. Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, of her own accord, came in with a large silver Tumbler, filled with Sack, and a Toast, and Nutmeg, and Sugar;<a id="exp-note_80"></a><a href="part0021_split_080.html#exp-note-80" class="nounder">*</a> and my Master said, That’s well thought of, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes;</em> for we have made but sorry Breakfastings. And he would make me take some of the Toast; as they all did, and drank pretty heartily: And I drank a little, and it chear’d my Heart, I thought, for an Hour after.</p>
<p class="indent">My Master took a fine Diamond Ring from his Finger, and presented it to Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters;</em> who receiv’d it very kindly. And to Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> he said, My old Acquaintance, I have reserv’d for you, against a Variety of Sollicitations, the Living I always design’d for you; and I beg you’ll prepare to take Possession of it; and as the doing it may be attended with some Expense, pray accept of this towards it; and so he gave him (as he told me afterwards it was) a Bank Note of 50 <em class="calibre6">l</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">So did this generous good Gentleman bless us all, and me in <a id="page_347"></a>particular; for whose sake he was as bounteous as if he had marry’d one of the noblest Fortunes.</p>
<p class="indent">So he took his Leave of the Gentlemen, recommending Secrecy again, for a few Days, and they left him; and none of the Servants suspected any thing, as Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> believes. And then I threw myself at his Feet, blessing God, and blessing him for his Goodness, and he overwhelm’d me with Kindness; calling me his sweet Bride, and twenty lovely Epithets, that swell my grateful Heart beyond the Power of Utterance.</p>
<p class="indent">He afterwards led me to the Chariot; and we took a delightful Tour round the neighbouring Villages; and he did all he could, to dissipate those still perverse Anxieties that dwell upon my Mind, and, do what I can, spread too thoughtful an Air, as he tells me, over my Countenance.</p>
<p class="indent">We came home again by half an Hour after One; and he was pleasing himself with thinking, not to be an Hour out of my Company this blessed Day, that (as he was so good as to say) he might inspire me with a Familiarity that should improve my Confidence in him, when he was told, that a Footman of Sir <em class="calibre6">Charles Hargrave</em> had been here, to let him know, that his Master, and two other Gentlemen, were on the Road to take a Dinner with him, in their Way to <em class="calibre6">Nottingham</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">He was heartily vex’d at this, and said to me, He should have been glad of their Companies at any other Time; but that it was a barbarous Intrusion now; and he wish’d they had been told he would not be at home at Dinner: And besides, said he, they are horrid Drinkers, and I shan’t be able to get them away to Night, perhaps; for they have nothing to do, but travel round the Country, and beat up their Friends Quarters all the Way; and ’tis all one to them, whether they stay a Night, or a Month, at a Place. But, added he, I’ll find some way, if I can, to turn them off, after Dinner.—Confound them, said he, in a violent Pet, that they should come this Day, of all the Days in the Year!</p>
<p class="indent">We had hardly alighted, and got in, before they came; three mad Rakes they seem’d to be, as I looked out of the Window, setting up a Hunting-note, as soon as they came to the Gate, that made the Court-yard echo again, and smacking their Whips in Concert.</p>
<p class="indent">So I went up to my Chamber, and saw (what made my Heart throb) Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>’s officious Pains to put the Room in Order for a <a id="page_348"></a>Guest, that however welcome, as now my Duty teaches me to say, is yet dreadful to me to think of. So I refuged myself in my Closet, and had recourse to Pen and Ink, for my Amusement, and to divert my Anxiety of Mind.—If one’s Heart is so sad, and one’s Apprehensions so great, where one so extremely loves, and is so extremely obliged; What must be the Case of those poor Maidens, who are forced, for sordid Views, by their tyrannical Parents, or Guardians, to marry the Man they almost hate, and, perhaps, to the Loss of the Man they most love? O that is a sad thing indeed!—And what have not such cruel Parents to answer for? and what do not such poor innocent Victims suffer?—But, blessed be God, this Lot is far from being mine!</p>
<p class="indent">My good Master, for I cannot yet have the Presumption to call him by a more tender Epithet, came up to me; and said, Well, I just came to ask my dear Bride! (O the charming, charming Word!) how she does? I see you are writing, my Dear, said he. These confounded Rakes are half mad, I think, and will make me so! However, said he, I have order’d my Chariot to be got ready, as if I was under an Engagement five Miles off, and will set them out of the House, if possible; and then ride round, and come back, as soon as I can get rid of them. I find, said he, Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> is full of our Affairs. She has taken great Freedoms with me before Sir <em class="calibre6">Charles;</em> and they have all been at me, without Mercy; and I was forced to be very serious with them, or else they would have come up to have seen you, as I would not call you down.—He kissed me, and said, I shall quarrel with them, if I can’t get them away; for I have lost two or three precious Hours with my Soul’s Delight; and so he went down.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> ask’d me to walk down to Dinner in the little Parlour. I went down, and she was so complaisant as to offer to wait upon me at Table; and would not be persuaded, without Difficulty, to sit down with me. But I insisted she should; For, said I, it would be very extraordinary if one should so soon go into such Distance, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes!</em>—Whatever the Station of our good Master may require of me, added I, I hope I shall always conduct myself in such a manner, that Pride and Insolence shall bear no Part in my Character. You are very good, Madam, said she; but I will always know my Duty to my Master’s Lady.—Why then, reply’d I, if I must take State upon me so early, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, let me exact from you what you call your Duty; and sit down with me when I desire you. This prevailed upon her; <a id="page_349"></a>and I made shift to eat a bit of Apple-pie, and a little Custard; but I had no Appetite to any thing else.</p>
<p class="indent">My good Master came in again, and said, Well, thank my Stars! these Rakes are going now; but I must set out with them; and I chuse my Chariot; for if I took Horse, I should have Difficulty to part with them; for they are like a Snow-ball, and intend to gather Company as they go, to make a merry Tour of it for some Days together. We both got up, when he came in; Fie, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said he! why this Ceremony now?—Sit still, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes!</em>—Nay, Sir, said she, I was loth to sit down, but my Lady would have me!—She is very right, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, said my Master, and tapp’d me on the Cheek; for we are not yet half marry’d; and so she is not above half your Lady yet!—Don’t look so down, don’t be so silent, my Dearest, said he; why, you hardly spoke twenty Words to me all the time we were out together. Something I will allow for your bashful Sweetness; but not too much.—Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, have you no pleasant Tales to tell my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, to make her smile, till I return?—Yes, Sir, said she, I could tell twenty pleasant Stories; but my Lady is too nice to hear them; and yet, I hope, I should not be shocking neither. Ah! poor Woman! thought I; thy chastest Stories will make a modest Person blush, if I know thee; and I desire to hear none of them. My Master said, Tell her one of the shortest you have, in my Hearing. Why, Sir, said she, I knew a bashful young Lady, as Madam may be, marry’d to——Dear Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, interrupted I, no more of your Story, I beseech you! I don’t like the Beginning of it. Go on, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, said my Master. No, pray, Sir, don’t require it, said I; pray don’t. Well, said he, then we’ll have it another time, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">And so <em class="calibre6">Abraham</em> coming to tell him, the Gentlemen were going, and his Chariot was ready; Thank God, said he; and went to them, and sat out with them. I took a Turn in the Garden, with Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, after they were gone: And having walked a-while, I said, I should be glad of her Company down the Elm-walk, to meet the Chariot: For, Oh! I know not how to look up at him, when he is with me; nor how to bear his Absence, when I have Reason to expect him! What a strange Contradiction there is in this unaccountable Passion!</p>
<p class="indent">What a different Aspect every thing in and about this House bears now, to my thinking, to what it once had! The Garden, the Pond, the Alcove, the Elm-walk. But, Oh! my Prison is become my Palace; and no wonder every thing wears another Face! We sat down upon the <a id="page_350"></a>broad Style, leading towards the Road, and Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> was quite another Person to me, to what she was the last time I sat there!</p>
<p class="indent">At last my best Beloved return’d, and alighted there. What, my <em class="calibre6">Pamela!</em> (said he, and kissed me) brings you this way? I hope, to meet me?—Yes, Sir, said I. That’s kind, indeed, said he; but why that averted Eye?—that down-cast Countenance, as if you was afraid of me? You must not think so, Sir, said I. Revive my Heart then, said he, with a more chearful Aspect; and let that over-anxious Sollicitude which appears in the charmingest Face in the World, be chased from it.—Have you, my dear Girl, any Fears that I can dissipate; any Doubts that I can obviate; any Hopes that I can encourage; any Request that I can gratify? Speak, my dear <em class="calibre6">Pamela;</em> and if I have Power, <em class="calibre6">but</em> speak, and to purchase one Smile, it shall be done!</p>
<p class="indent">I cannot, Sir, said I, have any Fears, any Doubts, but that I shall never be able to deserve all your Goodness. I have no Hopes, but that my future Conduct may be agreeable to you, and my determined Duty well accepted. Nor have I any Request to make, but that you will forgive all my Imperfections; and, among the rest, this foolish Weakness, that makes me seem to you, after all the generous Things that have passed, to want this further Condescension, and these kind Assurances. But, indeed, Sir, I am oppress’d by your Bounty; my Spirits sink under the Weight of it; and the Oppression is still the greater, as I see not how, possibly, in my whole future Life, by all I can do, to merit the least of your Favours.</p>
<p class="indent">I know your grateful Heart, said he, but remember, my Dear, what the Lawyers tell us, That Marriage is the highest Consideration which the Law knows. And this, my sweet Bride, has made you mine, and me yours; and you have the best Claim in the World to share my Fortune with me. But, set that Consideration aside, what is the Obligation you have to me? Your Mind is pure as that of an Angel, and as much transcends mine. Your Wit and your Judgment, to make you no Compliment, are more than equal to mine: You have all the Graces that Education can give a Woman; improv’d by a Genius which makes those Graces natural to you. You have a Sweetness of Temper, and a noble Sincerity, beyond all Compare; and in the Beauty of your Person, you excel all the Ladies I ever saw. Where then, my Dearest, is the Obligation, if not on my side to you?—But to avoid these Comparisons, let us talk of nothing henceforth but Equality; for if you will set the Riches of your Mind, and your <a id="page_351"></a>unblemished Virtue, against my Fortune, (which is but an accidental Good, as I may call it, and all I have to boast of) the Condescension will be yours; and I shall not think I can possibly deserve you, till, after your sweet Example, my future Life shall become nearly as blameless as yours.</p>
<p class="indent">O Sir, said I, what Comfort do you give me, that, instead of my being in Danger of being insnared by the high Condition to which your Goodness has exalted me, you make me hope, that I shall be confirm’d and improv’d by you; and that we may have a Prospect of perpetuating each other’s Happiness, till Time shall be no more!—But, Sir, I will not, as you once caution’d me, be too serious. I will resolve, with these sweet Encouragements, to be, in every thing, what you would have me be! And I hope I shall, more and more, shew you that I have no Will but yours. He kissed me very tenderly, and thanked me for this kind Assurance, as he called it. And so we enter’d the House, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> having left us as soon as my Master alighted.</p>
