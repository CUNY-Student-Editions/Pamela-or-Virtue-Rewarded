<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">Eight o’Clock at Night</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">NOW these sweet Assurances, my dear Father and Mother, you will say, must be very Consolatory to me, and voluntierly on his Side, all that could be wish’d for on mine; and I was resolved, if possible, to subdue my idle Fears and Apprehensions.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">Ten o’Clock at Night</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">AS we sat at Supper, he was generously kind to me, as well in his Actions as Expressions. He took notice, in the most delicate manner, of my Endeavour to conquer my Foibles, and said, I see, with Pleasure, my dear Girl strives to comport herself in a manner suitable to my Wishes: I see even thro’ the sweet tender Struggles of your over-nice Modesty, how much I owe to your Desire of obliging me. As I have once told you, that I am the Conquest more of your Virtue than your Beauty; so, not one alarming Word or Look shall my beloved <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> hear or see, to give her Reason to suspect the Truth of what I aver. You may the rather believe me, continued he, as you may see the Pain I have to behold any thing that concerns you, even tho’ your Concern be causeless. And yet I will indulge my dear Girl’s bashful Weakness so far, as to own that so pure a Mind may suffer from <a id="page_352"></a>Apprehension, on so important a Change as this; and I can therefore be only displeased with such Part of your Conduct, as may make your Sufferings greater than my own; when I am resolved, thro’ every Stage of my future Life, in all Events, to study to make them less.</p>
<p class="indent">After Supper, of which, with all his sweet Persuasions, I could hardly taste, he made me drink two Glasses of Champaign, and afterwards a Glass of Sack; which he kindly forced upon me, by naming your Healths: And as the Time of retiring drew on, he took notice, but in a very delicate manner, how my Colour went and came; and how foolishly I trembled. Nobody, surely, in such delightful Circumstances, ever behav’d so silly!—And he said, My dearest Girl, I fear you have had too much of my Company for so many Hours together; and would better recollect yourself, if you retir’d for half an Hour to your Closet.</p>
<p class="indent">I wished for this, but durst not say so much, lest he should be angry; for, as the Hours grew on, I found my Apprehensions increase, and my silly Heart was the unquieter, every time I could lift up my Eyes to his dear Face; so sweetly terrible did he appear to my Apprehensions. I said, You are all Goodness, dear Sir; and I boldly kissed his dear Hand, and pressed it to my Lips, with both mine. And he saluting me very fervently, gave me his Hand, seeing me hardly able to stand, and led me to my Chamber-door, and then most generously withdrew.</p>
<p class="indent">I went to my Closet; and the first thing I did, on my Knees, again thanked God for the Blessing of the Day; and besought his Divine Goodness to conduct my future Life in such a manner, as should make me a happy Instrument of his Glory. After this, being now left to my own Recollection, I grew a little more assured and lightsome; and the Pen and my Paper being before me, I amused myself with writing thus far.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">Eleven o’clock THURSDAY Night</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">MRS. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> being come up with a Message, desiring to know, whether her Master may attend upon me in my <em class="calibre6">Closet;</em> and hinting to me, that, however, she believed, he did not expect to find me <em class="calibre6">there</em>, I have sent Word, that I beg he would indulge me one Quarter of an Hour.—So, committing myself to the Mercies of the Almighty, who <a id="page_353"></a>has led me thro’ so many strange Scenes of Terror and Affrightment, to this happy, yet awful Moment, I will wish you, my dear Parents, a good Night; and tho’ you will not see this in time, yet I know I have your hourly Prayers; and therefore cannot fail of them now. So, Good-night, Good-night! God bless you, and God bless me. <em class="calibre6">Amen, Amen</em>, if it be his blessed Will, subscribes</p>
<p class="right"><em class="calibre6">Your ever dutiful Daughter!</em></p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">FRIDAY Evening</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">O How this dear, excellent Man indulges me in every thing! Every Hour he makes me happier, by his sweet Condescension, than the former. He pities my Weakness of Mind, allows for all my little Foibles, endeavours to dissipate my Fears; his Words are so pure, his Ideas so chaste, and his whole Behaviour so sweetly decent, that never, surely, was so happy a Creature as your <em class="calibre6">Pamela!</em> I never could have hoped such a Husband could have fallen to my Lot! And much less, that a Gentleman, who had allow’d himself in Attempts, that now I will endeavour to forget for ever, should have behav’d with so very delicate and unexceptionable a Demeanour. No light, frothy Jests drop from his Lips; no alarming Railleries; no offensive Expressions, nor insulting Airs, reproach or wound the Ears of your happy, thrice happy Daughter. In short, he says every thing that may embolden me to look up, with Pleasure, upon the generous Author of my Happiness.</p>
<p class="indent">At Breakfast, when I knew not how to see him, he embolden’d me by talking of <em class="calibre6">you</em>, my dear Parents; a Subject, he generously knew, I could talk of: And gave me Assurances, that he would make you both happy. He said, he would have me send you a Letter, to acquaint you with my Nuptials; and, as he could make Business that way, <em class="calibre6">Thomas</em> should carry it purposely, as to-morrow. Nor will I, said he, my dear <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, desire to see your Writings, because I told you I would not; for now will I, in every thing, religiously keep my Word with my dear Spouse (O the dear delightful Word!); and you may send all your Papers to them, from those they have, down to this happy Moment; only let me beg they will preserve them, and let me have them when they have read them, as also those I have not seen; which, however, I desire not to see till then; but then shall take it for a Favour, if you will grant it.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_354"></a>It will be my Pleasure, as well as my Duty, Sir, said I, to obey you in every thing. And I will write up to the Conclusion of this Day, that they may see how happy you have made me.</p>
<p class="indent">I know you will both join with me to bless God for his wonderful Mercies and Goodness to you, as well as to me: For he was pleased to ask me particularly after your Circumstances, and said, he had taken notice that I had hinted, in some of my first Letters, that you ow’d Money in the World; and he gave me Fifty Guineas, and bid me send them to you in my Pacquet, to pay your Debts, as far as they would go; and that you would quit your present Business, and put yourself, and my dear Mother, into a creditable Appearance; and he would find a better Place of Abode for you than that you had, when he returned to <em class="calibre6">Bedfordshire</em>. O how shall I bear all these exceeding great and generous Favours!—I send them, wrapt up, Five Guineas in a Parcel, in double Papers.</p>
<p class="indent">To me he gave no less than One hundred Guineas more; and said, I would have you, my Dear, give Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, when you go away from hence, what you think fit, out of these, as from yourself!—Nay, good dear Sir, said I, let that be what you please. Give her then, said he, Twenty Guineas, as a Compliment on your Nuptials. Give <em class="calibre6">Colbrand</em> Ten Guineas: Give the two Coachmen, Five Guineas each; to the two Maids at this House, Five Guineas each: Give <em class="calibre6">Abraham</em> Five Guineas: Give <em class="calibre6">Thomas</em> Five Guineas; and give the Gardeners, Grooms and Helpers, Twenty Guineas among them. And when, said he, I return with you to the other House, I will make you a suitable Present, to buy you such Ornaments as are fit for my beloved Wife to appear in. For now, my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, continu’d he, you are not to mind, as you once proposed, what other Ladies will say; but to appear as my Wife ought to do. Else it will look as if what you thought of, as a Means to avoid the Envy of others of your Sex, was a wilful Slight in me, which, I hope, I never shall be guilty of; and I will shew the World, that I value you as I ought, and as if I had marry’d the first Fortune in the Kingdom: And why should it not be so? When I know none of the first Quality that matches you in Excellence?</p>
<p class="indent">He saw I was at a Loss for Words, and said, I see, my dearest Bride! my Spouse! my Wife! my <em class="calibre6">Pamela!</em> your grateful Confusion. And kissing me, as I was going to speak, I will stop your dear Mouth, said he: You shall not so much as thank me; for when I have done ten times more than, this, I shall but poorly express my Love for so much <a id="page_355"></a>Beauty of Mind, and Loveliness of Person; which thus, said he, and clasped me to his generous Bosom, I can proudly now call my own!—O how can I think of any thing, but returned Love, Joy and Gratitude!</p>
<p class="indent">And thus generously did he banish from my Mind those painful Reflections, and bashful Apprehensions, that made me dread to see him, for the first time this Day, when I was called to attend him at Breakfast, and made me all Ease, Composure and Tranquillity.</p>
<p class="indent">He then, thinking I seem’d somewhat thoughtful, proposed a little Turn in the Chariot, till Dinner-time; and this was another sweet Relief to me; and he diverted me with twenty agreeable Relations, of what Observations he had made in his Travels; and gave me the Characters of the Ladies and Gentlemen in his other Neighbourhood; telling me whose Acquaintance he would have me most cultivate; and when I mention’d Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>, with Apprehension, he said, To be sure I love my Sister dearly, notwithstanding her violent Spirit; and I know she loves me; and I can allow a little for her Pride, because I know what once my own was; and because she knows not my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, and her Excellencies, as I do. But you must not, my Dear, forget what belongs to your Character, as my Wife, nor meanly stoop to her; tho’ I know you will chuse, by Softness, to try to move her to a proper Behaviour. But it shall be my Part to see that you do not yield too much.</p>
<p class="indent">However, continued he, as I would not publickly declare my Marriage here, I hope she won’t come near us till we are in <em class="calibre6">Bedfordshire</em>; and then, when she knows we are marry’d, she will keep away, if she is not willing to be reconcil’d; for she dare not, surely, come to quarrel with me, when she knows it is done; for that would have an hateful and wicked Appearance, as if she would try to make Differences between Man and Wife.—But we will have no more of this Subject, nor talk of any thing, added he, that shall give Concern to my Dearest. And so he changed the Talk to a more pleasing Subject, and said the kindest and most soothing things in the World.</p>
<p class="indent">When we came home, which was about Dinner-time, he was the same obliging, sweet Gentleman; And, in short, is studious to shew, on every Occasion, his generous Affection to me. And, after Dinner, he told me, he had already wrote to his Draper, in Town, to provide him new Liveries; and to his late Mother’s Mercer, to send him <a id="page_356"></a>down Patterns of the most fashionable Silks, for my Choice. I told him, I was unable to express my Gratitude for his Favours and Generosity; and as he knew best what befitted his own Rank and Condition, I would wholly remit myself to his good Pleasure; but, by all his repeated Bounties to me, of so extraordinary a Nature, I could not but look forward with Awe, upon the Condition to which he had exalted me; and now I feared I should hardly be able to act up to it in such a manner as should justify the Choice he had condescended to make. But that, I hoped, I should have not only his generous Allowance for my Imperfections, which I could only assure him should not be wilful ones, but his kind Instructions; and that as often as he observ’d any Part of my Conduct such as he would have alter’d, and could not intirely approve, that he would let me know it; and I would think his Reproofs of beginning Faults the kindest and most affectionate things in the World; because they would keep me from committing greater; and be a Means to continue to me the Blessing of his good Opinion.</p>
<p class="indent">He answer’d me in the kindest manner; and assured me, That nothing should ever lie upon his Mind which he would not reveal, and give me an Opportunity either of convincing him, or being convinced myself.</p>
<p class="indent">He then asked me, When I should be willing to go to the <em class="calibre6">Bedfordshire</em> House? I said, Whenever he pleased. Said he, We will come down hither again before the Winter, if you please, in order to cultivate the Acquaintance you have begun with Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em>, and Sir <em class="calibre6">Simon</em>’s Family; and, if it please God to spare us to one another, in the Winter I will give you, as I promised, for two or three Months, my Company in <em class="calibre6">London</em>. And, I think, added he, if my Dear pleases, we will set out next Week, about <em class="calibre6">Tuesday</em>, for t’other House. I can have no Objection, Sir, said I, to any thing you propose; but how will you avoid Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em>’s Sollicitation for an Evening, to dance? Why, said he, we can make <em class="calibre6">Monday</em> Evening do for that Purpose, if they won’t excuse us. But, if you please, said he, I will invite Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em>, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em> and his Family, and Sir <em class="calibre6">Simon</em> and his Family, to my little Chapel, on <em class="calibre6">Sunday</em> Morning, and to stay Dinner with me; and then I will declare my Marriage to them, because my dear Life shall not leave this Country, with the least Reason for a Possibility of any body’s doubting that it is so. Oh! how good this was!—But, indeed, his Conduct is all of a Piece, noble, kind, and considerate! What a <a id="page_357"></a>happy Creature, by God’s Goodness, am I!—And then, may-be, said he, they will excuse us till we return into this County again, as to the Ball. Is there any thing, added he, that my beloved <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> has still to wish? if you have, freely speak.</p>
<p class="indent">Hitherto, my dearest Sir, reply’d I, you have not only prevented my Wishes, but my Hopes, and even my Thoughts. And yet I must own, since your kind Command of speaking my Mind, seems to shew that you expect from me, I should say something, that I have only one or two things to wish more, and then I shall be too happy. Say, said he, what they are? Sir, proceeded I, I am, indeed, ashamed to ask any thing, lest it should not be agreeable to you; and lest it should look as if I was taking Advantage of your kind Condescensions to me, and knew not when to be satisfy’d!</p>
<p class="indent">I will only tell you, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said he, that you are not to imagine, that these things which I have done, in hopes of obliging you, are the sudden Impulses of a <em class="calibre6">new</em> Passion for you. But, if I can answer for my own Mind, they proceed from a regular and uniform Desire of obliging you; which, I hope, will last as long as your Merit lasts; and that, I make no doubt, will be as long as I live; and I can the rather answer for this, because I really find so much Delight in myself in my present way of Thinking and Acting, as infinitely over-pays me; and which, for that Reason, I am likely to continue for <em class="calibre6">both</em> our sakes. My beloved <em class="calibre6">Wife</em>, therefore, said he, for, methinks, I am grown fond of a Name I once despised, may venture to speak her Mind; and I will promise, that, so far as it is agreeable to me, and I chearfully can, I will comply; and you will not insist upon it, if that cannot be the Case.</p>
<p class="indent">To be sure, Sir, said I, I ought not, neither will I. And now you embolden me to become an humble Petitioner; and that, as I ought, upon my Knees, for the reinstating such of your Servants, as I have been the unhappy Occasion of their disobliging you. He raised me up, and said, My beloved <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> has too often been in this suppliant Posture to me, to permit it any more. Rise, my Fairest, and let me know whom, in particular, you would reinstate; and he kindly held me in his Arms, and pressed me to his beloved Bosom. Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>, Sir, said I, in the first place; for she is a good Woman; and the Misfortunes she has had in the World, make your Displeasure most heavy to her.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, said he, who next? Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>, Sir, said I; and, I am sure, <a id="page_358"></a>kind as they have been to me, yet would I not ask it, if I could not vouch for their Integrity, and if I did not think it was my dear Master’s Interest to have such good Servants.</p>
<p class="indent">Have you any thing further? said he.—Sir, said I, your good old Butler, who has so long been in your Family, before the Day of your happy Birth; I would, if I might, become an Advocate for!</p>
<p class="indent">Well, said he, I have only to say, That had not Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>, and Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>, and <em class="calibre6">Jonathan</em> too, joined in a Body, in a bold Appeal to Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>, which has given her the insolent Handle she has taken to intermeddle in my Affairs, I could easily have forgiven all the rest of their Conduct; tho’ they have given their Tongues no little Licence about me; but I could have forgiven them, because I desire every body to love you; and it is with Pride that I observe the Opinion and Love of them, and every body else that knows you, justify my own.—But yet, I will forgive even this, because my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> desires it; and I will send a Letter myself, to tell <em class="calibre6">Longman</em> what he owes to your Interposition, if the Estate he has made in my Family, does not set him above the Acceptance of it. And, as to Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>, do you, my Dear, write a Letter to her, and give her your Commands, instantly, on the Receipt of it, to go and take Possession of her former Charge; for now, my dearest Girl, she will be more immediately your Servant; and I know you love her so well, that you’ll go thither with the more Pleasure, to find her there.—But don’t think, added he, that all this Compliance is to be for nothing. Ah! Sir, said I, tell me but what I can do, poor as I am in Power, but rich in Will; and I will not hesitate one Moment. Why then, said he, of your own Accord, reward me for my chearful Compliance, with one sweet Kiss.—I instantly said, Thus then, dear Sir, will I obey; and, Oh! you have the sweetest and most generous way in the World, to make that a Condition, which gives me double Honour, and adds to my Obligations. And so I clasped my Arms about his Neck, and was not ashamed to kiss him once, and twice, and three times, once for every forgiven Person.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, my dearest <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said he, what other things have you to ask? Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> is already taken Care of; and, I hope, will be happy.—Have you nothing to say for <em class="calibre6">John Arnold?</em></p>
<p class="indent">Why, dear Sir, said I, you have seen the poor Fellow’s Penitence in my Letters.—Yes, my Dear, so I have; but that is his Penitence for his having serv’d me, against you; and, I think, when he would have <a id="page_359"></a>betray’d me afterwards, he deserves nothing to be said or done for him by either.</p>
<p class="indent">But, dear Sir, said I, this is a Day of Jubilee; and the less he deserves, poor Fellow, the more will be your Goodness. And let me add one Word: That as he was divided in his Inclinations between his Duty to you, and good Wishes to me, and knew not how to distinguish between the one and the other, when he finds us so happily united by your great Goodness to me, he will have no more Puzzles in his Duty; for he has not failed in any other Part of it; but, I hope, will serve you faithfully for the future.</p>
<p class="indent">Well then, suppose I put Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> in a good way of Business, in some Inn, and give her <em class="calibre6">John</em> for a Husband? And then your Gypsey Story will be made out, that she will have a Husband younger than herself.</p>
<p class="indent">You are all Goodness, Sir, said I. I can freely forgive poor Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, and wish her happy. But permit me, Sir, to ask, Would not this look like a very heavy Punishment to poor <em class="calibre6">John?</em>—And as if you could not forgive him, when you are so generous to every body else?</p>
<p class="indent">He smiled, and said, O my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, this for a forgiving Spirit, is very severe upon poor <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>: But I shall never, by the Grace of God, have any more such trying Services to put him or the rest upon; and if <em class="calibre6">you</em> can forgive him, I think <em class="calibre6">I</em> may; and so <em class="calibre6">John</em> shall be at your Disposal. And now let me know, what my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> has further to wish?</p>
<p class="indent">O my dearest Sir, said I, not one single Wish more has your grateful <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>. My Heart is overwhelm’d with your Goodness! Forgive these Tears of Joy, added I!—You have left me nothing to pray for, but that God will bless you with Life, and Health, and Honour, and continue to me the Blessing of your Esteem; and I shall then be the happiest Creature in the World.</p>
<p class="indent">He clasped me in his Arms, and said, You cannot, my dear Life, be so happy in me, as I am in you. O how heartily I despise all my former Pursuits and headstrong Appetites! what Joys, what true Joys, flow from virtuous Love! Joys which the narrow Soul of the Libertine cannot take in, nor his Thought conceive!—And which I myself, whilst a Libertine, had not the least Notion of!</p>
<p class="indent">But, said he, I expected, my dear Spouse, my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, had something to ask for herself: But since all her own Good is absorbed in the Delight her generous Heart takes in promoting that of others, it shall <a id="page_360"></a>be my Delight to prevent her Wishes, and to study to make her Care for herself unnecessary, by my anticipating Kindness.</p>
<p class="indent">In this manner, my dear Parents, is your happy Daughter blessed in a Husband! O how my exulting Heart leaps at the dear, dear Word!—And I have nothing to do, but to be humble, and to look up with Gratitude to the all-gracious Dispenser of these Blessings!</p>
<p class="indent">So, with a thousand Thanks, I afterwards retired to my Closet, to write you thus far. And having compleated what I purpose for this Pacquet, and put up the kind, obliging Present, I have nothing more to say, but that I hope soon to see you both, and receive your Blessings on this happy, thrice happy Occasion. And so, hoping for your Prayers, that I may preserve an humble and upright Mind to my gracious God, a dutiful Gratitude to my dear Master and Husband,—that I may long rejoice in the Continuance of these Blessings and Favours, and that I may preserve, at the same time, an obliging Deportment to every one else, I conclude myself,</p>
<p class="right"><em class="calibre6">Your ever dutiful and most happy Daughter</em>,</p>
<p class="right">P<small class="calibre2">AMELA</small> B——.</p>
<p class="hangingpara">O think it not my Pride, my dear Parents, that sets me on glorying in my Change of Name. Yours will be always dear to me, and what I shall never be ashamed of, I am sure! But yet—For such a Husband!—What shall I say, since Words are too faint to express my Gratitude and my Joy!</p>
<p class="hangingpara">I have taken Copies of my Master’s Letter to Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>, and mine to Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>, which I will send with the further Occurrences when I go to the other dear House, or give you when I see you, as I now hope soon to do.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">SATURDAY Morning, the Third of my happy Nuptials</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">I Must still write on, till I come to be settled in the Duty of the Station to which I am so generously exalted, and to let you participate with me the transporting Pleasures that arise from my new Condition, and the Favours that are hourly heaped upon me by the best of Husbands. When I had got my Pacquet for you finish’d, I then set about writing, as he had kindly directed me, to Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>; and had no Difficulty till I came to sign my Name; and so I brought it down with me, when I was called to Supper, unsigned.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_361"></a>My good Master, I hardly have yet the Courage to call him freely by a tenderer Name, had been writing to Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>; and he said, pleasantly, See here, my Dearest, what I have written to your <em class="calibre6">Somebody</em>. I read as follows:<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">‘<em class="calibre6">Mr</em>. L<small class="calibre2">ONGMAN</small>,</p>
<p class="noindent">‘I Have the Pleasure to acquaint you, that last <em class="calibre6">Thursday</em> I was marry’d to my beloved <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>. I have had Reason to be disobliged with you, and Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em> and <em class="calibre6">Jonathan</em>, not for your Kindness to, and Regard for my dear Spouse, that now is, but for the manner in which you appealed to my Sister <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>; which has made a very wide Breach between her and me. But as it was one of her first Requests, that I would overlook what had past, and reinstate you all in your former Charges, I think myself obliged, without the least Hesitation, to comply with it. So, if you please, you may enter again upon an Office which you have always executed with unquestionable Integrity, and to the Satisfaction of</p>
<p class="right">‘<em class="calibre6">Yours</em>, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="indent">‘<em class="calibre6">Friday Afternoon</em>.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="hangingpara">‘I shall set out next <em class="calibre6">Tuesday</em> or <em class="calibre6">Wednesday</em>, God willing, for <em class="calibre6">Bedfordshire</em>; and desire to find <em class="calibre6">Jonathan</em>, as well as you, in your former Offices; in which, I dare say, you’ll have the more Pleasure, as you have such an early Instance of the Sentiments of my dear Wife, from whose Goodness you may expect every agreeable thing. She writes herself to Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>.’<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">I thanked him most gratefully for his Goodness, and afterwards took the above Copy of it. And shew’d him my Letter to Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>, as follows:<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">‘<em class="calibre6">My dear Mrs</em>. J<small class="calibre2">ERVIS</small>,</p>
<p class="noindent">‘I Have joyful Tidings to communicate to you. For Yesterday I was happily marry’d to the best of Gentlemen, yours and my beloved Master. I have only now to tell you, that I am inexpressibly happy: That my generous Benefactor denies me nothing, and even anticipates my Wishes. You may be sure I could not forget my dear Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>; and I made it my Request, and had it granted, as soon as asked, that you might return to the kind Charge, which you executed with so much Advantage to our Master’s Interest, and so much <a id="page_362"></a>Pleasure to all under you Direction. All the Power that is put into my Hands, by the most generous of Gentlemen, shall be exerted to make every thing easy and agreeable to you; and as I shall soon have the Honour of attending my beloved Spouse to <em class="calibre6">Bedfordshire</em>, it will be a very considerable Addition to my Delights, and to my unspeakable Obligations to the best of Men, to see my dear Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>, and to be received by her with that Pleasure, which I promise myself from her Affection. For I am, my dear good Friend, and always will be,</p>
<p class="right">‘<em class="calibre6">Yours, very affectionately and gratefully</em>,</p>
<p class="right">‘P<small class="calibre2">AMELA</small>——.’</p>
<p class="indent">He read this Letter, and said, ’Tis Yours, my Dear, and must be good: But don’t you put your Name to it? Sir, said I, your Goodness has given me a Right to a very honourable one: But as this is the first Occasion of this kind, except that to my dear Father and Mother, I think I ought to shew it you unsign’d, that I may not seem over-forward to take Advantage of the Honour you have done me.</p>
<p class="indent">However sweetly humble and requisite, said he, this may appear to my dear <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>’s Niceness, it befits me to tell you, that I am, every Moment, more and more pleased with the Right you have to my Name: And, my dear Life, added he, I have only to wish I may be half as worthy as you are of the happy Knot so lately knit. He then took a Pen himself, and wrote after <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, his most worthy Surname; and I under-wrote thus: ’O rejoice with me, my dear Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>, that I am enabled, by God’s Graciousness, and my dear Master’s Goodness, thus to write myself.’</p>
<p class="indent">These Letters, and the Pacquet to you, were sent away by Mr. <em class="calibre6">Thomas</em> early this Morning.</p>
<p class="indent">My dearest Master is just gone to take a Ride out, and intends to call upon the Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em>, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em>, and Sir <em class="calibre6">Simon Darnford</em>, to invite them to Chapel and Dinner to-morrow; and says, he chuses to do it himself, because the Time is so short, they will, perhaps, deny a Servant.</p>
<p class="indent">I forgot to mention, that Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> was here Yesterday, to ask Leave to go to see his new Living, and to provide for taking Possession of it; and seem’d so pleased with my Master’s Kindness and Fondness for me, as well as his generous Deportment to himself, that he left us in such a Disposition, as shew’d him quite happy. I am very glad of it; for it would rejoice me to be an humble Means of making <a id="page_363"></a>all Mankind so: And Oh! what Returns ought I not to make to the Divine Goodness! and how ought I to strive to diffuse the Blessings I experience, to all in my Knowledge!—For else, what is it for such a Worm as I to be exalted! What is my <em class="calibre6">single</em> Happiness, if I suffer it, Niggard-like, to extend no further than myself?—But then, <em class="calibre6">indeed</em>, do God Almighty’s Creatures act worthy of the Blessings they receive, when they make, or endeavour to make, the whole Creation, so far as is in the Circle of their Power, happy!</p>
<p class="indent">Great and good God! as thou hast enlarged my Opportunities, enlarge also my Will, and make me delight in dispensing to others, a Portion of that Happiness which I have myself so plentifully receiv’d at the Hands of thy gracious Providence! Then shall I not be useless in my Generation!—Then shall I not stand a single Mark of God’s Goodness to a poor worthless Creature, that in herself is of so poor Account in the Scale of Beings, a mere Cypher<a id="exp-note_81"></a><a href="part0021_split_081.html#exp-note-81" class="nounder">*</a> on the wrong Side of a Figure; but shall be placed on the right Side; and, tho’ nothing worth in myself, shall give Signification by my Place, and multiply the Blessings I owe to God’s Goodness, who has distinguish’d me by so fair a Lot!</p>
<p class="indent">This, as I conceive, is the indispensable Duty of a high Condition; and how great must be the Condemnation of poor Creatures, at the great Day of Account, when they shall be asked, What Uses they have made of the Opportunity put into their Hands? and are able only to say, We have lived but to ourselves. We have circumscribed all the Power thou hast given us into one narrow, selfish Circle: We have heaped up Treasures for those who came after us, tho’ we know not whether they will not make a still worse Use of them than we ourselves did. And how can such poor selfish Pleaders expect any other Sentence, than the dreadful, <em class="calibre6">Depart, ye Cursed!</em><a id="exp-note_82"></a><a href="part0021_split_082.html#exp-note-82" class="nounder">*</a></p>
<p class="indent">But sure, my dear Father and Mother, such Persons can have no Notion of the exalted Pleasures that flow from doing Good, were there to be no After-account at all!</p>
<p class="indent">There is something so satisfactory and pleasing to Reflection, on the being able to administer Comfort and Relief to those who stand in need of it, as infinitely rewards the beneficent Mind. And how often have I experienced this in my good Lady’s time; tho’ but the second-hand Dispenser of her Benefits to the Poor and Sickly, when she made me her Almoner!—How have I been affected with the Blessings which the Miserable have heaped upon her for her <a id="page_364"></a>Goodness, and upon me for being but the humble Conveyer of her Bounty to them!—And how delighted have I been, when the moving Reports I have made of a particular Distress, has augmented my good Lady’s first Intentions in its Relief!</p>
<p class="indent">This I recall, with Pleasure, because it is now, by God’s Goodness, become my Part to do those good things she was wont to do: And Oh! let me watch myself, that my prosperous State do not make me forget to look up with due Thankfulness, to the Providence which has intrusted me with the Power, that so I may not incur a terrible Woe by the Abuse or the Neglect of it!</p>
<p class="indent">Forgive me these Reflections, my dear Parents, and let me have your Prayers, that I may not find my present Happiness a Snare to me; but that I may consider, that more and more will be expected from me, in Proportion to the Power given me; and that I may not so unworthily act as if I believ’d I ought to set up my Rest in my <em class="calibre6">mean Self</em>, and think nothing further to be done, with the Opportunities put into my Hand, by the Divine Favour, and the best of Men!</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">SATURDAY, Seven o’Clock in the Evening</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">MY Master return’d home to Dinner, in Compliment to me, tho’ much press’d to dine with Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em>, as he was also by Sir <em class="calibre6">Simon</em>, to dine with him. But Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em> could not conveniently provide a Preacher for his own Church to-morrow Morning, at so short a Notice; Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> being gone, as I said, to his new Living; but believed he could for the Afternoon; and so he promised to give his Company to Dinner, and to read Afternoon Service; and this made my Master invite all the rest, as well as him, to Dinner, and not to Church; and made them promise to come; and told Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em>, he would send his Coach for him and his Family.</p>
<p class="indent">Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em> told him, pleasantly, she would not come, unless he would promise to let her be at his Wedding; by which, I find, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em> has kept the Secret, as my Master desired.</p>
<p class="indent">He was pleased to give me an Airing after Dinner in the Chariot, and renew’d his kind Assurances to me, and, if possible, is kinder than ever. This is sweetly comfortable to me; because it shews me, he does not repent of his Condescensions to me; and it encourages me to look up to him with more Satisfaction of Mind, and less Doubtfulness.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_365"></a>I begg’d Leave to send a Guinea to a poor Body in the Town, that I heard, by Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, lay very ill, and was very destitute. He said, Send two, my Dear, if you please. Said I, Sir, I will never do any thing of this kind without letting you know what I do. He most generously answer’d, I shall then, perhaps, have you do less Good than you would otherwise do, from a Doubt of me; tho’, I hope, your Discretion, and my own Temper, which is not avaricious, will make such Doubt causeless.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, my Dear, continued he, I’ll tell you how we will order this Point, to avoid even the Shadow of Uneasiness on one side, or Doubt on the other.</p>
<p class="indent">As to your Father and Mother, in the first Place, they shall be quite out of the Question; for I have already determined in my Mind about them; and it is thus: They shall go down, if they and you think well of it, to my little <em class="calibre6">Kentish</em> Estate; which I once mentioned to you in such a manner, as made you reject it with a Nobleness of Mind, that gave me Pain then, but Pleasure since. There is a pretty little Farm and House, untenanted, upon that Estate, and tolerably stock’d, and I will further stock it for them; for such industrious Folks won’t know how to live without some Employment; and it shall be their’s for both their Lives, without paying any Rent; and I will allow them 50 <em class="calibre6">l. per Annum</em> besides, that they may keep up the Stock, and be kind to any other of your Relations, without being beholden to you or me, for small matters; and for greater, where needful, you shall always have it in your Power to accommodate them; for I shall never question your Prudence. And we will, so long as God spares our Lives, go down once a Year to see them, and they shall come up as often as they please, it cannot be too often, to see us; for I mean not this, my Dear, to send them from us.—Before I proceed, Does my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> like this?</p>
<p class="indent">O, Sir, said I, either I have not Words, or else the <em class="calibre6">English</em> Tongue affords them not, to express sufficiently my Gratitude. Learn me, dear Sir, continued I, and pressed his dear Hands to my Lips, learn me some other Language, if there be any, that abounds with more grateful Terms, that I may not thus be choaked with Meanings, for which I can find no adequate Utterance.</p>
<p class="indent">My Charmer! says he, your Language is all wonderful, as your Sentiments; and you most abound when you seem most to want!—All that I wish, is, to find my Proposals agreeable to you; and if my <a id="page_366"></a><em class="calibre6">first</em> are not, my <em class="calibre6">second</em> shall be, if I can but know what you wish.</p>
<p class="indent">Did I say too much, my dearest Parents, when I said, he was, if possible, kinder and kinder!—O the blessed Man! How my Heart is overwhelmed with his Goodness!</p>
<p class="indent">Well, said he, my Dearest, let me desire you to mention this to them, and see if they approve it. But if it be your Choice, and theirs, to have them nearer to you, or even under the Roof with you, I will freely consent to it.</p>
<p class="indent">O no, Sir, said I (and I fear almost sinn’d in my grateful Flight) I am sure they would not chuse that; they could not, perhaps, serve God so well, if they were to live with you; for, so constantly seeing the Hand that blesses them, they would, may-be, as must be my Care to avoid, be tempted to look no further in their Gratitude, than to the dear Dispenser of such innumerable Benefits!</p>
<p class="indent">Excellent Creature! said he, my Beloved wants no Language, nor Sentiment neither! and her charming Thoughts, so sweetly express’d, would grace any Language; and this is a Blessing almost peculiar to my Fairest.—Your so kind Acceptance, my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, added he, repays the Benefit, with Interest, and leaves me under Obligation to your Goodness.</p>
<p class="indent">But now, my Dearest, I will tell you what we will do, with regard to Points of your own private Charity; for, far be it from me, to put under that Name the Subject we have been mentioning: Because that, and more than that, is <em class="calibre6">Duty</em>, to Persons so worthy, and so nearly related to my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, and, as such, to myself.—O how the sweet Man outdoes me in Thoughts, Words, Power, and every thing!</p>
<p class="indent">And this, said he, lies in very small Compass; for I will allow you Two hundred Pounds a Year, which <em class="calibre6">Longman</em> shall constantly pay you, at Fifty Pounds a Quarter, for your own Use, and of which I expect no Account; to commence from the Day you enter into my other House; I mean, said he, that the first Fifty Pounds shall then be due; because you shall have something to begin with. And, added the dear generous Man, if this be pleasing to you, let it, since you say you want Words, signify it by such a sweet Kiss as you gave me Yesterday. I hesitated not a Moment to comply with these obliging Terms, and threw my Arms about his dear Neck, tho’ in the Chariot, and blessed his Goodness to me. But indeed, Sir, said I, I cannot bear this generous Treatment. He was pleased to say, Don’t be uneasy, my Dear, about these Trifles; God has bless’d me with a very good Estate, and <a id="page_367"></a>all of it in a prosperous Condition, and well tenanted. I lay up Money every Year, and have besides, large Sums in Government and other Securities; so that you will find, what I have hitherto promised, is very short of that Proportion of my Substance, which, as my dearest Wife, you have a Right to.</p>
<p class="indent">In this sweet manner did we pass the Time till Evening, when the Chariot brought us home; and then our Supper succeeded in the same agreeable manner. And thus, in a rapturous Circle, the Time moves on; every Hour bringing with it something more delightful than the past!—Sure nobody was ever so blest as I!</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">SUNDAY, the Fourth Day of my Happiness</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">NOT going to Chapel this Morning, the Reason of which I told you, I bestowed the Time, from the Hour of my Beloved’s rising, to Breakfast, in Prayer and Thanksgiving, in my Closet; and now I begin to be quite easy, chearful and free in my Spirits; and the rather, as I find myself encouraged by the Tranquility, Serenity, and pleasing Vivacity in the Temper and Behaviour of my beloved Spouse; who thereby shews he does not repent of his Goodness to me.</p>
<p class="indent">I attended him to Breakfast, and drank my Chocolate with great Pleasure, and eat two Bits of Toast; and he seemed quite pleased with me, and said, Now does my Dearest begin to look upon me with an Air of Serenity and Satisfaction: It shall be always, added he, my Delight to give you Occasion for this sweet becoming Aspect of Confidence and Pleasure in me—My Heart, dear Sir, said I, is quite easy, and has lost all its foolish Tumults, which combating with my Gratitude, gave an ingrateful Appearance to my Behaviour: But now your Goodness, Sir, has enabled it to get the better of its uneasy Apprehensions, and my Heart is all of one Piece, and devoted to you, and grateful Tranquillity. And could I be so happy as to see you and my good Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> reconciled, I have nothing in this World to wish for more, but the Continuance of your Favour. He said, I wish this Reconciliation, my Dearest, as well as you; and I do assure you, more for your sake than my own: And if she would behave tolerably, I would make the Terms easier to her for that Reason.</p>
<p class="indent">He said, I will lay down one Rule for you, my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, to observe in your Dress; and I will tell you every thing I like or dislike, as it occurs to me; and I would have you do the same, on your Part, that <a id="page_368"></a>nothing may lie upon either of our Minds that shall occasion the least Reservedness.</p>
<p class="indent">I have often observed, in marry’d Folks, that, in a little while, the Lady grows careless in her Dress; which, to me, looks as if she would take no Pains to secure the Affection she had gained, and shews a Slight to her Husband, that she had not to her Lover: Now, you must know, this has always given me great Offence; and I should not forgive it, even in my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>; tho’ she would have this Excuse for herself, that thousands could not make, That she looks lovely in every thing. So, my Dear, I shall expect of you always, to be dress’d by Dinner-time, except something extraordinary happens; and this, whether you are to go abroad, or stay at home. For this, my Love, will continue to you that sweet Ease in your Dress and Behaviour, which you are so happy a Mistress of; and whoever I bring home with me to my Table, you will be in Readiness to receive them; and will not want to make those foolish Apologies, to unexpected Visitors, that carry with them a Reflection on the Conduct of those who make them; and besides, will convince me, that you think yourself obliged to appear as graceful to your Husband, as you would to Persons less familiar to your Sight.</p>
<p class="indent">This, dear Sir, said I, is a most obliging Injunction; and I most heartily thank you for it, and will always take care to obey it.—Why, my Dear, said he, you may better do this than half your Sex: Because they too generally act in such a manner, as if they seem’d to think it the Privilege of Birth and Fortune, to turn Day into Night, and Night into Day, and are seldom stirring till ’tis time to sit down to Dinner; and so all the good old Family Rules are revers’d; for they breakfast when they should dine; dine, when they should sup; and sup, when they should go to-bed; and, by the Help of dear Quadrille,<a id="exp-note_83"></a><a href="part0021_split_083.html#exp-note-83" class="nounder">*</a> sometimes go to-bed when they should rise.—In any thing but these, my Dear, continued he, I expect you to be a Lady. And my good Mother was one of this old-fashion’d Cut, tho’, in all other respects, as worthy a Lady as any in the Kingdom. And so you have not been used to the new Way, and may the easier practise the other.</p>
<p class="indent">Dear Sir, said I, pray give me more of your sweet Injunctions. Why then, continued he, I shall, in the usual Course, and generally, if not hinder’d by Company, like to go to-bed with my Dearest, by Eleven; and if I don’t, shan’t hinder you. I ordinarily now rise by Six, in Summer. I will allow you to lie half an Hour after me, or so.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_369"></a>Then you’ll have some time at your own Dispose, till you give me your Company to breakfast; which may be always so, as that we may have done at a little after Nine.</p>
<p class="indent">Then will you have several Hours, again, at your Disposal, till Two o’Clock, when I shall like to sit down at Table.</p>
<p class="indent">You will then have several useful Hours more to employ yourself in, as you shall best like; and I would generally go to Supper by Eight; and when we are resolved to stick to these old-fashion’d Rules, as near as we can, we shall make our Visitors conform to them too, and expect them from us, and suit themselves accordingly: For I have always observ’d, that it is in every one’s Power to prescribe Rules to himself. It is only standing a few ridiculous Jests at first, and that too from such, generally, as are not the most worthy to be minded; and, after a while, they will say, It signifies nothing to ask him: He will have his own Way. There is no putting him out of his Byass. He is a regular Piece of Clockwork, will they joke, and all that: And why, my Dear, should we not be so? For Man is as frail a Piece of Machinery, as any Clockwork whatever; and, by Irregularity, is as subject to be disorder’d.</p>
<p class="indent">Then, my Dear, continued the charming Man, when they see they are received, at my Times, with an open Countenance and chearful Heart; when they see Plenty and Variety at my Board, and meet a kind and hearty Welcome from us both, they will not offer to break in upon my Conditions, nor grudge me my regular Hours: And as most of these People have nothing to do, except to rise in a Morning, they may as well come to Breakfast with us, at half an Hour after Eight, in Summer, as at Ten or Eleven. To Dinner at Two, as at Four, Five, or Six; and to Supper at Eight, as at Ten or Eleven. And then our Servants too will know, generally, the Times of their Business, and the Hours of their Leisure or Recess; and we, as well as they, shall reap the Benefit of this Regularity. And who knows, my Dear, but we may revive the good old Fashion in our Neighbourhood, by this means?—At least, it will be doing our own Parts towards it; and answering the good Lesson I learned at School, <em class="calibre6">Every one mend one</em>.<a id="exp-note_84"></a><a href="part0021_split_084.html#exp-note-84" class="nounder">*</a> And the worst that will happen will be, that when some of my Brother Rakes, such as those we were broke in upon, so unwelcomly, last <em class="calibre6">Thursday</em>, are got out of the Way, if that can ever be, and fall to considering whom they shall go to dine with in their Rambles, they will only say, We must not go to him; for his Dinner-time is over; and <a id="page_370"></a>so they’ll reserve me for another time, when they happen to suit it better; or, perhaps, they will take a Supper and a Bed with me instead of it.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, my Dearest, continued the kind Man, you see here are more of my Injunctions, as you call them; and tho’ I will not be so set, as to quarrel if they are not always exactly comply’d with; yet, as I know you won’t think them unreasonable, I shall be glad they may as often as they can; and you will give your Orders accordingly, to <em class="calibre6">your</em> Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>, who is a good Woman, and will take Pleasure in obeying you.</p>
<p class="indent">O dearest, dear Sir, said I, have you no more of your sweet Injunctions to honour me with? They oblige and improve me at the same time!—What a happy Lot is mine!—God Almighty reward your Goodness to me!</p>
<p class="indent">Why, let me see, my Dearest, said he.—But I think of no more at present. For it would be needless to say, how much I value you for your Sweetness of Temper, and that open Chearfulness of Countenance which adorns you, when nothing has given my Fairest Apprehensions for her Virtue: A Sweetness, and a Chearfulness, that prepossesses in your Favour, at first Sight, the Mind of every one that beholds you.—I need not, I hope, say, that I would have you diligently preserve this sweet Appearance: Let no thwarting Accident, no cross Fortune, (for we must not expect to be exempt from such, happy as we now are in each other!) deprive this sweet Face of this its principal Grace: And when any thing unpleasing happens, in a quarter of an Hour, at farthest, begin to mistrust yourself, and apply to your Glass; and if you see a Gloom arising, or arisen, banish it instantly, smooth your dear Countenance, resume your former Composure; and then, my Dearest, whose Heart must always be seen in her Face, and cannot be a Hypocrite, will find this a means to smooth her Passions also; and if the Occasion be too strong for so sudden a Conquest, she will know how to do it more effectually, by repairing to her Closet, and begging that gracious Assistance, which has never yet failed her: And so shall I, my Dear, who, as you once, but too justly, observ’d, have been too much indulged by my good Mother, have an Example from you, as well as a Pleasure in you which will hardly ever be palled.</p>
<p class="indent">One thing, continued he, I have frequently observed, at the Houses of other Gentlemen, That when we have unexpectedly visited, or broke in upon the Family Order, laid down by their <a id="page_371"></a>Ladies; and especially if any of us have lain under the Suspicion of having occasionally seduced our marry’d Companion into bad Hours, or given indifferent Examples, the poor Gentleman has been oddly affected at our coming; tho’ the good Breeding of the Lady has made her just keep up Appearances. He has looked so conscious; has been so afraid, as it were, to disoblige; has made so many Excuses for some of us, before we have been accused, as has always shewn me how unwelcome we have been; and how much he is obliged to compound with his Lady for a tolerable Reception of us; and, perhaps, she too, in Proportion to the honest Man’s Concern to court her Smiles, has been more reserv’d, stiff and formal; and has behav’d with an Indifference, and Slight, that has often made me wish myself out of <em class="calibre6">her</em> House; for too plainly have I seen, that it was not <em class="calibre6">his</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">This, my Dear, you will judge by my Description, has afforded me Subject for Animadversion upon the marry’d Life; for a Man may not (tho’, in the main, he is willing to flatter himself, that he is Master of his House, and will assert himself upon great Occasions, when his Prerogative is strongly invaded) be always willing to contend; and such Women as those I have described, are always ready to take the Field, and are worse Enemies than the old <em class="calibre6">Parthians</em>,<a id="exp-note_85"></a><a href="part0021_split_085.html#exp-note-85" class="nounder">*</a> who annoy most, when they seem to retreat; and never fail to return to the Charge again, and carry on the offensive War, till they have tired out Resistance, and made the Husband willing, like a vanquish’d Enemy, to compound for small Matters, in order to preserve something. At least, the poor Man does not care to let his Friends see his Case, and so will not provoke a Fire to break out, that, he sees, (and so do his Friends too) the meek Lady has much ado to smother; and which, very possibly, burns with a most comfortable Ardour, after we are gone.</p>
<p class="indent">You smile, my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said he, at this whimsical Picture; and I am sure, I never shall have Reason to include you in these disagreeable Out-lines; but yet I will say, that I expect from you, whoever comes to my House, that you accustom yourself to one even, uniform Complaisance: That no Frown take place on your Brow: That however ill or well provided we may be for their Reception, you shew no Flutter or Discomposure: That whoever you may have in your Company at the Time, you signify not, by the least reserved Look, that the Stranger is come upon you unseasonably, or at a Time you wished not. But be facetious, kind, obliging to all; and if to any one <a id="page_372"></a>more than another, to such as have the least Reason to expect it from you, or who are most inferior at the Table; for thus will you, my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, chear the doubting Mind, quiet the uneasy Heart, and diffuse Ease, Pleasure, and Tranquillity around my Board.</p>
<p class="indent">And be sure, my Dear, continued he, let no little Accidents ruffle your Temper. I shall never forget once, that I was at Lady <em class="calibre6">Arthur</em>’s; and a Footman happen’d to stumble, and let fall a fine China Dish, and broke it all to pieces: It was grievous to see the Uneasiness it gave the poor Lady. And she was so sincere in it, that she suffer’d it to spread all over the Company, and it was a pretty large one too; and not a Person in it, but turn’d either her Consoler, or fell into Stories of the like Misfortunes; and so we all became, for the rest of the Evening, nothing but blundering Footmen, and careless Servants, or were turn’d into broken Jars, Plates, Glasses, Tea-cups, and suchlike brittle Substances. And it affected me so much, that when I came home, I went to-bed, and dreamt, that <em class="calibre6">Robin</em>, with the Handle of his Whip, broke the Fore-glass of my Chariot; and I was so sollicitous, methought, to keep the good Lady in Countenance for <em class="calibre6">her</em> Anger, that I broke his Head in Revenge, and stabb’d one of my Coach-horses. And all the Comfort I had when it was done, methought, was, that I had not exposed myself before Company; and there were no Sufferers but guilty <em class="calibre6">Robin</em>, and one innocent Coach-horse; for when my Hand was in, I might as reasonably have killed the other three.</p>
<p class="indent">I was exceedingly diverted with these facetious Hints, and the pleasant manner in which he gave them; and I promis’d to improve by the excellent Lessons contain’d in them.</p>
<p class="indent">I then went up and dressed myself, as like a Bride as I could, in my best Cloaths, and, on Enquiry, finding my dearest Master was gone to walk in the Garden, I went to find him out. He was reading in the little Alcove; and I said, Sir, am I licens’d to intrude upon you, without your Commands?—No, my Dear, said he, because you cannot <em class="calibre6">intrude</em>. I am so wholly yours, that where-ever I am, you have not only a Right to join me; but you do me a very acceptable Favour at the same time.</p>
<p class="indent">I have, Sir, said I, obey’d your first kind Injunction, as to dressing myself before Dinner; but, may-be, you are busy, Sir? He put up the Paper he was reading, and said, I can have no Business or Pleasure of equal Value to your Company, my Dear. What was you going to <a id="page_373"></a>say?—Only, Sir, to know, if you have any more kind Injunctions to give me?—I could hear you talk a whole Day together.—You are very obliging, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said he; but you are so perfectly what I wish, that I might have spar’d those I gave you; but I was willing you should have a Taste of my Freedom with you, to put you upon the like with me. For I am confident there can be no Friendship lasting without Freedom, and without communicating to one another even the little Caprices, if my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> can have any such, which may be most affecting to us.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, my Dear, said he, be so kind to find some Fault with me, and tell me what you would wish me to do, to appear more agreeable to you. O, Sir, said I, and I could have kissed him, but for Shame, (To be sure I shall grow a sad fond Hussy!) I have not one single thing to wish for; no, not one!—He saluted me very kindly, and said, he should be sorry if I had, and forbore to speak it. Do you think, my dear Sir, said I, that your <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> has no Conscience? Do you think, that because you so kindly oblige her, and delight in obliging her, that she must rack her Invention for Trials of your Goodness, and knows not when she is happy!—O my dearest Sir, added I, less than one half of the Favours you have so generously conferred upon me, would have exceeded my utmost Wishes!</p>
<p class="indent">My dear Angel, said he, and kissed me again, I shall be troublesome to you with my Kisses, if you continue thus sweetly obliging, in your Actions and Expressions. O Sir, said I, I have been thinking, as I was dressing myself, what an excellent Example you have given me of the Lessons you teach me. For here, Sir, you are most charmingly dress’d yourself, as you have commanded me, before Dinner.</p>
<p class="indent">Then, Sir, when you command me, at your Table, to chear the doubting Mind, and comfort the uneasy Heart, and to behave most kindly to those who have least Reason to expect it, and are most inferior; how sweetly, in every Instance that could possibly occur, have you done this yourself, by your poor, unworthy <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, till you have diffused, in your own dear Words, Ease, Pleasure and Tranquillity around my glad Heart.</p>
<p class="indent">Then again, Sir, when you bid me not be disturbed by little Accidents, or by Strangers coming in upon me unexpectedly, how noble an Instance did you give me of this; when, on our dear Wedding day, the coming of Sir <em class="calibre6">Charles Hargrove</em>, and the other two Gentlemen, (for which you was quite unprovided, and hinder’d our Happiness of <a id="page_374"></a>dining together on that chosen Day) did not so disturb you, but that you entertained the Gentlemen pleasantly, and parted with them civilly and kindly!—What charming Instances are these, I have been recollecting with Pleasure, of your pursuing the Doctrine you deliver!</p>
<p class="indent">My Dear, said he, these Observations are very kind in you, and much to my Advantage: But if I do not always, (for I fear these were too much Accidents) so well pursue the Doctrines I lay down, my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> must not expect that my Imperfections will be a Plea for her Non-observance of my Lessons, as you call them; for, I doubt, I shall never be half so perfect as you; and so I cannot permit you to fall back in your Goodness, tho’ I may find myself unable to advance, as I ought, in my Duty.</p>
<p class="indent">I hope, Sir, said I, by God’s Grace, I never shall. I believe it, said he; but I only mention this, knowing my own Defects, lest my future Lessons should not be so well warranted by my Practice, as in the Instances you have kindly recollected.</p>
<p class="indent">He was pleased to take Notice of my Dress, and spanning my Waste with his Hands, said, What a sweet Shape is here! It would make one regret to lose it; and yet, my beloved <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, I shall think nothing but that Loss wanting, to complete my Happiness!—I put my bold Hand before his Mouth, and said, Hush, hush! O fie, Sir!—The freest thing you have ever yet said, since I have been yours!—He kissed my Hand, and said, Such an innocent Wish, my Dearest, may be permitted me, because it is the End of the Institution.—But say, Would such a Case be unwelcome to my <em class="calibre6">Pamela?</em>—I will say, Sir, said I, and hid my blushing Face on his Bosom, that your Wishes, in every thing, shall be mine; but pray, Sir, say no more!—He kindly saluted me, and thanked me, and changed the Subject.—I was not too free, I hope!</p>
<p class="indent">Thus we talked, till we heard the Coaches; and then he said, Stay here, in the Garden, my Dear, and I’ll bring the Company to you. And when he was gone, I passing by the Back-door, kneeled down against it, and blessed God for not permitting my then so much desired Escape. I went to the Pond, and kneeled down on the mossy Bank, and again blessed God there, for his Mercy in my Escape from myself, my then worst Enemy, tho’ I thought I had none but Enemies, and no Friend near me. And so I ought to do in almost every Step of this Garden, and every Room in this House!—And I <a id="page_375"></a>was bending my Steps to the dear little Chapel to make my Acknowledgment there; but I saw the Company coming towards me.</p>
<p class="indent">Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em> said, So, Miss! how do you do now? O, you look so easy, so sweetly, so pleased, that I know you’ll let me dance at your Wedding; for I shall long to be there. Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em> was pleased to say, I look’d like an Angel. And Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em> said, I improved upon them every time they saw me. Lady <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em> was also pleased to make me a fine Compliment, and said, I looked freer and easier every time she saw me. Dear-heart! I wish, thinks I, you would spare these Compliments; for I shall have some Joke, I doubt, passed upon me by-and-by, that will make me suffer for all these fine things.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em> said, softly, God bless you, dear <em class="calibre6">Daughter!</em>—But not so much as my Wife knows it.—Sir <em class="calibre6">Simon</em> came in last, and took me by the Hand, and said, ’Squire <em class="calibre6">B</em>. by your Leave. And kissed my Hand five or six times, as if he was mad; and held it with both his, and made a very free Jest, by way of Compliment, in his Way. Well, I think a <em class="calibre6">young Rake</em> is hardly tolerable; but an <em class="calibre6">old Rake</em>, and an <em class="calibre6">old Beau</em>, are two very sad Things!—And all this before Daughters Women-grown!—I whisper’d my Dearest, a little after, and said, I fear I shall suffer much from Sir <em class="calibre6">Simon</em>’s rude Jokes, by-and-by, when you reveal the Matter!—’Tis his way, my Dear, said he; you must now grow above these things.—Miss <em class="calibre6">Nanny Darnford</em> said to me, with a sort of half-grave, ironical Air,—Well, Miss, if I may judge by your easy Deportment now, to what it was when I last saw you, I hope you will let my Sister, if you won’t me, see the happy Knot ty’d! For she is quite wild about it.—I curcheed, and only said, You are all very good to me, Ladies.—Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em>’s Niece said, Well, Miss, I hope, before we part, we shall be told the happy Day. My good Master heard her, and said, You shall, you shall, Madam!—That’s pure! said Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">He took me aside, and said, softly, Shall I lead them to the Alcove, and tell them there, or stay till we go in to Dinner?—Neither, Sir, I think, said I; I fear I shan’t stand it.—Nay, said he, they must know it; I would not have invited them else.—Why then, Sir, said I, let it alone till they are going away.—Then, reply’d he, you must pull off your Ring. No, no, Sir, said I, that I must not.—Well, said he, do you tell Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em> of it yourself.—Indeed, Sir, answer’d I, I cannot.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> came officiously<a id="exp-note_86"></a><a href="part0021_split_086.html#exp-note-86" class="nounder">*</a> to ask my Master, just then, if she should bring a Glass of Rhenish and Sugar before Dinner for the <a id="page_376"></a>Gentlemen and Ladies; and he said, That’s well thought of; bring it, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">And she came, with <em class="calibre6">Nan</em> attending her, with two Bottles and Glasses, and a Salver; and must needs, making a low Curchee, offer first to me, saying, Will your Ladyship begin? I colour’d like Scarlet, and said, No;—my Master, to be sure!</p>
<p class="indent">But they all took the Hint; and Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em> said, I’ll be hang’d if they have not stole a Wedding. Said Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em>, It must be certainly so! Ah! Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">I’ll assure you, said he, I have not marry’d them. Where were you, said she, and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>, last <em class="calibre6">Thursday</em> Morning? Said Sir <em class="calibre6">Simon</em>, Let me alone, let me alone; if any thing has been stolen, I’ll find it out; I’m a Justice of the Peace, you know. And so he took me by the Hand, and said, Come, Madam, answer me, by the Oath you have taken; Are you marry’d or not?</p>
<p class="indent">My Master smiled to see me look so like a Fool; and I said, Pray, Sir <em class="calibre6">Simon!</em>—Ay, ay, said he, I thought you did not look so smirking upon us for nothing.—Well then, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said my Master, since your Blushes discover you, don’t be ashamed, but confess the Truth!</p>
<p class="indent">Now, said Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em>, I am quite angry. And said Lady <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em>, I am quite pleas’d; let me give you Joy, dear Madam, if it be so. And so they all said, and saluted me round.—I was vexed it was before Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>; for she shook her fat Sides, and seem’d highly pleas’d to be a Means of discovering it.</p>
<p class="indent">Nobody, said my Master, wishes me Joy. No, said Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em>, very obligingly, nobody need; for with such a peerless Spouse, you want no good Wishes!—And he saluted them; and when he came last to me, said, before them all, Now, my sweet Bride, my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, let me conclude with you; for here I began to love, and here I desire to end loving, but not till my Life ends.</p>
<p class="indent">This was sweetly said, and taken great Notice of; and it was doing Credit to his own generous Choice, and vastly more than I merited.</p>
<p class="indent">But I was forced to stand a many more Jokes afterwards. For Sir <em class="calibre6">Simon</em> said, several times, Come, come, Madam, now you are become one of us, I shall be a little less scrupulous than I have been, I’ll assure you.</p>
<p class="indent">When we came in to Dinner, I made no Difficulty of what all offer’d me, the Upper-end of the Table; and perform’d the Honours of it with pretty tolerable Presence of Mind, considering. And, with <a id="page_377"></a>much ado, my good Benefactor promising to be down again before Winter, we got off the Ball; but appointed <em class="calibre6">Tuesday</em> Evening, at Lady <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em>’s, to take Leave of all this good Company, who promised to be there, my Master designing to set out on <em class="calibre6">Wednesday</em> Morning for <em class="calibre6">Bedfordshire</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">We had Prayers in the little Chapel, in the Afternoon; but they all wished for the good Clerk again, with great Encomiums upon you, my dear Father; and the Company staid Supper also, and departed exceeding well satisfied, and with abundance of Wishes for the Continuance of our mutual Happiness; and my Master desired Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em> to answer for him to the Ringers, at the Town,<a id="exp-note_87"></a><a href="part0021_split_087.html#exp-note-87" class="nounder">*</a> if they should hear of it, till our Return into this Country, and that then he would be bountiful to them; because he would not publickly declare it till he had first done so in <em class="calibre6">Bedfordshire</em>.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">MONDAY, the fifth Day</em>.</h4>
<p class="indent">I Have had very little of my dear Friend’s Company this Day; for he only staid Breakfast with me, and rid out to see a sick Gentleman about eighteen Miles off, who begg’d (by a Man and Horse on purpose) to speak with him, believing he should not recover, and upon Part of whose Estate my Master has a Mortgage. He said, My Dearest, I shall be very uneasy, if I am oblig’d to tarry all Night from you; but, lest you should be alarm’d, if I don’t come home by Ten, don’t expect me: For poor Mr. <em class="calibre6">Carlton</em> and I have pretty large Concerns together, and if he should be very ill, and would be comforted by my Presence, (as I know he loves me, and his Family will be more in my Power if he dies, than I wish for) Charity will not let me refuse.</p>
<p class="indent">It is now Ten o’Clock at Night, and I fear he will not return. I fear for the sake of his poor sick Friend, who I doubt is worse. Tho’ I know not the Gentleman, I am sorry for his own sake, for his Family’s sake, and for my dear Master’s sake, who by his kind Expressions I find loves him: And methinks I should be sorry any Grief should touch his generous Heart; tho’ yet, there is no living in this World, without too many Occasions for Concern, even in the most prosperous State. And it is fit it should be so; or else, poor Wretches as we are! we should look no further, but be like sensual Travellers on a Journey homeward, who, meeting with good Entertainment at some Inn on the Way, put up their Rest there, and never think of pursuing <a id="page_378"></a>their Journey to their proper Home.—This, I remember, was often a Reflection of my good Lady’s, to whom I owe it.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">Eleven o’Clock</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">MRS. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> has been with me, and ask’d if I will have her for a Bedfellow in want of a better? I said, I thank’d her; but I would see how it was to lie by myself one Night.</p>
<p class="indent">I might have mention’d, that I made Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> dine and sup with me, and she was much pleas’d with it, and my Behaviour to her. And I could see by her Manner, that she was a little struck inwardly at some of her former Conduct to me. But, poor Wretch, it is, I must fear, because I am what I am; for she has otherwise very little Remorse, I doubt.—Her Talk and Actions are intirely different from what they us’d to be, quite circumspect and decent; and I should have thought her virtuous, and even pious, had I never known her in another Light.</p>
<p class="indent">By this, we may see, my dear Father and Mother, of what Force Example is; and what is in the Power of the Heads of Families to do: And this shews, that evil Examples, in Superiors, are doubly pernicious, and doubly culpable, because such Persons are bad <em class="calibre6">themselves</em>, and not only do no <em class="calibre6">Good</em>, but much <em class="calibre6">Harm</em>, to <em class="calibre6">others</em>; and the Condemnation of such must, to be sure, be so much the greater!—And how much the greater still must my Condemnation be, who have had such a religious Education under you, and been so well nurtur’d by my good Lady, if I should forget, with all these Mercies heap’d upon me, what belongs to the Station God has preferr’d me to!—Oh how I long to be doing some Good! For all that is past yet, is my dear, dear Master’s; God bless him! and return him safe to my Wishes; for methinks already ’tis a Week since I saw him! If my Love would not be troublesome and impertinent, I should be nothing else; for I have a true grateful Spirit, and I had Need to have such a one; for I am poor in every thing but Will.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">TUESDAY Morning, Eleven o’Clock</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">MY dear, dear—Master (I’m sure I should still say; but I will learn to rise to a softer Epithet, now-and-then) is not yet come. I hope he is safe and well!—So Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> and I went to Breakfast. But I can <a id="page_379"></a>do nothing but talk and think of him, and all his Kindness to me, and to you, which is still me, more intimately!—I have just receiv’d a Letter from him, which he wrote Over-night, as I find by it, and sent early the next Morning. This is a Copy of it.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>

<p class="noindent">‘I Hope my not coming home this Night will not frighten you. You may believe I can’t help it. My poor Friend is so very ill, that I doubt he can’t recover. His Desires to have me stay with him are so strong, that I shall sit up all Night with him, as it is now near One o’Clock in the Morning; for he can’t bear me out of his Sight: And I have made him and his distress’d Wife and Children so easy, in the kindest Assurances I could give him, of my Consideration for him and them, that I am look’d upon (as the poor disconsolate Widow, as she, I doubt, will soon be, tells me) as their good Angel. I could have wish’d we had not engag’d to the good Neighbourhood at Sir <em class="calibre6">Simon</em>’s for to-morrow Night; but I am so desirous to set out on <em class="calibre6">Wednesday</em> for the other House, that, as well as in Return for the Civilities of so many good Friends, who will be there on Purpose, I would not put it off. What I beg of you, therefore, my Dear, is, that you would go in the Chariot to Sir <em class="calibre6">Simon</em>’s, the sooner in the Day the better, because you will be diverted with the Company, who all so much admire you; and I hope to join you there by your Tea-time in the Afternoon, which will be better than going home, and returning with you, as it will be six Miles Difference to me; and I know the good Company will excuse my Dress, on the Occasion. I count every Hour of this little Absence for a Day; for I am, with the utmost Sincerity,</p>
<p class="right">‘<em class="calibre6">My dearest Love</em>,</p>
<p class="right">‘<em class="calibre6">For ever Yours</em>, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="hangingpara">‘If you could go to dine with them, it will be a Freedom that would be very pleasing to them, and the more, as they don’t expect it.’<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">I began to have a little Concern, lest his Fatigue should be too great, and for the poor sick Gentleman and Family; but told Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, that the least Intimation of his Choice should be a Command to me, and so I would go to Dinner there; and order’d the Chariot to <a id="page_380"></a>be got ready to carry me: when a Messenger came up, just as I was dress’d, to tell her, she must come down immediately. I see at the Window, that Visitors are come; for there is a Chariot and six Horses, the Company gone out of it, and three Footmen on Horseback; and I think the Chariot has Coronets. Who can it be, I wonder?—But here I will stop, for I suppose I shall soon know.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">Good-sirs! how unlucky this is! What shall I do?—Here is Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> come; her ownself! And my kind Protector a great, great many Miles off.—Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> out of Breath comes and tells me this, and says she is inquiring for my Master and me. She ask’d her, it seems, naughty Lady as she is, if I was <em class="calibre6">whor’d</em> yet! There’s a Word for a Lady’s Mouth!—Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> says, she knew not what to answer. And my Lady said, She is not marry’d, I hope? And, said she, I said, No; because you have not own’d it yet publickly. My Lady said, That was well enough. Said I, I will run away, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>; and let the Chariot go to the Bottom of the Elm-walk, and I will steal out of the Door unperceiv’d.—But, said she, she is inquiring for you, Madam, and I said you was within, but going out; and she said, she would see you presently, as soon as she could have Patience. What did she call me, said I? <em class="calibre6">The Creature</em>, Madam: <em class="calibre6">J will see the Creature</em>, said she, <em class="calibre6">as soon as I can have Patience</em>. Ay, but, said I, <em class="calibre6">the Creature</em> won’t let her, if she can help it.</p>
<p class="indent">Pray, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> favour my Escape for this once, for I am sadly frighted.—Said she, I’ll bid the Chariot go down as you order, and wait till you come; and I’ll step down, and shut the Hall-door, that you may pass down unobserv’d; for she sits cooling herself in the Parlour over-against the Stair-case. That’s a good Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes!</em> said I: But who has she with her? Her Woman, said she, and her Nephew; but he is on Horseback, and is gone into the Stables; and they have three Foot-men.—And I wish, said I, they were all <em class="calibre6">three</em> hundred Miles off!—What shall I do!—So I wrote thus far, and wait impatiently to hear the Coast is clear.—<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> tells me, I must come down, or she will come up. What does she call me now? said I. <em class="calibre6">Wench</em>, Madam. <em class="calibre6">Bid the Wench come down to me</em>. And her Nephew, and her Woman are with her.</p>
<p class="indent">Said I, I can’t go, and that’s enough!—You might contrive it that I might get out, if you would.—Indeed, Madam, said she, I cannot; for I went to shut the Door, and she bid me let it stand open; and <a id="page_381"></a>there she sits over-against the Stair-case. Then, said I, I’ll get out of the Window, I think!—(and fann’d myself) for I am sadly frighted. Laud, Madam, said she, I wonder you so much disturb yourself!—You’re on the right Side the Hedge, I’m sure; and I would not be so discompos’d for any body. Ay, said I, but who can help Constitution? I dare say you would no more be so discompos’d, than I can help it.—Said she, Indeed, Madam, if it was to me, I would put on an Air as Mistress of the House, as you are, and go and salute her Ladyship, and bid her welcome. Ay, ay, reply’d I, fine Talking!—But how unlucky this is, your good Master is not at home!</p>
<p class="indent">What Answer shall I give her, said she, to her desiring to see you?—Tell her, said I, I am sick a-bed; I’m dying,<a id="exp-note_88"></a><a href="part0021_split_088.html#exp-note-88" class="nounder">*</a> and must not be disturb’d; I’m gone out,—or any thing!</p>
<p class="indent">But her Woman came up to me, just as I had utter’d this, and said, How do you do, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Pamela?</em> My Lady desires to speak with you. So I must go.—Sure she won’t beat me!—Oh that my dear Protector was at home!</p>
<p class="indent">Well, now I will tell you all that happen’d in this frightful Interview.—And very bad it was.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">I went down, dress’d as I was, and my Gloves on, and my Fan in my Hand, to be just ready to get into the Chariot, when I could get away; and I thought all my trembling Fits had been over now; but I was mistaken, for I trembled sadly. Yet resolv’d to put on as good an Air as I could.</p>
<p class="indent">So I went to the Parlour, and said, making a very low Curchee, Your Servant, my good Lady! And your Servant again, said she, <em class="calibre6">my Lady</em>; for I think you are dress’d out like one.</p>
<p class="indent">A charming Girl tho’, said her rakish Nephew, and swore a great Oath; dear Aunt, forgive me, but I must kiss her, and was coming to me. And I said, Forbear, uncivil Gentleman! I won’t be us’d freely. <em class="calibre6">Jackey</em>, said my Lady, sit down, and don’t touch the Creature!—She’s proud enough already. There’s a great Difference in her Air, I’ll assure you, since I saw her last.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, Child, said she, sneeringly, how dost find thyself?—Thou’rt mightily come on of late!—I hear strange Reports about thee!—Thou’rt almost got into Fool’s Paradise, I doubt!—And wilt find thyself terribly mistaken in a little while, if thou thinkest my Brother will disgrace his Family to humour thy Baby-face!</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_382"></a>I see, said I, sadly vex’d, (her Woman and Nephew smiling by) your Ladyship has no very important Commands for me, and I beg Leave to withdraw. <em class="calibre6">Beck</em>, said she, to her Woman, shut the Door; my young Lady and I must not have done so soon.</p>
<p class="indent">Where’s your well-manner’d Deceiver gone, Child? says she.—Said I, When your Ladyship is pleas’d to speak intelligibly, I shall know how to answer.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, but my dear Child, said she in Drollery, don’t be too pert neither, I beseech thee. Thou wilt not find thy Master’s Sister half so ready to take thy Freedoms, as thy mannerly Master is!—So, a little of that Modesty and Humility that my Mother’s Waiting-maid used to shew, will become thee better than the Airs thou givest thyself, since my Mother’s Son has taught thee to forget thyself.</p>
<p class="indent">I would beg, said I, one Favour of your Ladyship, that if you would have me keep my Distance, you will not forget your own Degree.—Why, suppose, <em class="calibre6">Miss Pert</em>, I should forget my Degree, wouldst thou not keep thy Distance then?</p>
<p class="indent">If you, Madam, said I, lessen the Distance yourself, you will descend to my Level, and make an Equality, which I don’t presume to think of; for I can’t descend lower than I am,—at least in your Ladyship’s Esteem!</p>
<p class="indent">Did I not tell you, <em class="calibre6">Jackey</em>, said she, that I should have a Wit to talk to?—He, who swears like a Gentleman, at every Word, rapt out an Oath, and said, drolling, I think, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, if I may be so bold as to say so, you should know you are speaking to Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers!</em>—Sir, said I, I hope there was no Need for your Information, and so I can’t thank you for it; especially as you seem to think it wants an Oath to convince me of it.</p>
<p class="indent">He look’d more foolish than I at this, if possible, not expecting such a Reprimand—And said at last, Why, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, you put me half out of Countenance with your witty Reproof!—Sir, said I, you seem quite a fine Gentleman, and it will not be easily done, I dare say.</p>
<p class="indent">How now, Pert-ones, said my Lady, do you know who you talk to?—I think I do not, Madam, reply’d I: And, for fear I should forget myself more, I’ll withdraw. Your Ladyship’s Servant, said I, and was going: But she rose, and gave me a Push, and pull’d a Chair, and setting the Back against the Door, sat down in it.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, said I, I can bear any thing at your Ladyship’s Hands; but I <a id="page_383"></a>was ready to cry tho’. And I went, and sat down, and fann’d myself at the other End of the Room.</p>
<p class="indent">Her Woman, who stood all the Time, said softly, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, you should not sit in my Lady’s Presence. And my Lady, tho’ she did not hear her, said, You shall sit down, Child, in the Room where I am, when I give you Leave.</p>
<p class="indent">So I stood up, and said, When your Ladyship will hardly permit me to stand, one might be indulg’d to sit down. But I ask’d you, said she, Whither your Master is gone? To one Mr. <em class="calibre6">Carlton</em>, Madam, said I, about eighteen Miles off, who is very sick. And when does he come home?—This Evening, Madam, said I. And where are you going? To a Gentleman’s House in the Town, Madam. And how was you to go?—In the Chariot, Madam.—Why, you must be a Lady in time, to be sure!—I believe you’d become a Chariot mighty well, Child!—Was you ever out in it, with your Master?</p>
<p class="indent">Pray your Ladyship, said I, be pleased to ask half a dozen such Questions together; because one Answer may do for all!—Why, Boldface, said she, you’ll forget your Distance, and bring me to your Level before my Time.</p>
<p class="indent">So I could no longer refrain Tears, but said, Pray your Ladyship, let me ask what I have done to be thus severely treated? I never did your Ladyship any Harm. And if you think I am deceived, as you was pleas’d to hint, I should be more intitled to your Pity than your Anger.</p>
<p class="indent">She arose, and took me by the Hand, and led me to her Chair, and then sat down; and still holding my Hand, said, Why, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, I did indeed pity you while I thought you innocent; and when my Brother seiz’d you, and brought you down hither, without your Consent, I was concern’d for you. And I was still more concern’d for you, and lov’d you, when I heard of your Virtue and Resistance, and your virtuous Efforts to get away from him. But when, as I fear, you have suffer’d yourself to be prevail’d upon, and have lost your Innocence, and added another to the Number of the Fools he has ruin’d, (<em class="calibre6">This shock’d me a little!</em>) I cannot help shewing my Displeasure to you.</p>
<p class="indent">Madam, reply’d I, I must beg no hasty Judgment; I have not lost my Innocence!—Take care, take care, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said she!—Don’t lose your Veracity, as well as your Honour!—Why are you here, when you are at full Liberty to go whither you please?—I will make one Proposal to you, and if you are innocent, I am sure you’ll accept it. Will <a id="page_384"></a>you go and live with me?—I will instantly set out with you, in my Chariot, and not stay half an Hour longer in this House, if you’ll go with me.—Now, if you’re innocent, and willing to keep so, deny me, if you can.</p>
<p class="indent">I am innocent, Madam, reply’d I, and willing to keep so; and yet I cannot consent to this. Then, said she, very mannerly, Thou lyest, Child, that’s all; and I give thee up!</p>
<p class="indent">And so she arose, and walk’d about the Room in great Wrath. Her Nephew and her Woman said, Your Ladyship’s very good; ’tis a plain Case; a very plain Case!</p>
<p class="indent">I would have remov’d the Chair, to have gone out, but her Nephew came and sat in it. This provok’d me; for I thought I should be unworthy of the Honour I was rais’d to, tho’ I was afraid to own it, if I did not shew some Spirit; and I said, What, Sir, is your Pretence in this House, to keep me a Prisoner here? Because, said he,—I like it.—Do you so, Sir? reply’d I: If that’s the Answer of a Gentleman to such a one as I, it would not, I dare say, be the Answer of a Gentleman to a Gentleman.—My Lady! my Lady! said he, a Challenge, a Challenge, by Gad! No, Sir, said I, I am of a Sex that gives no Challenges; and you think so too, or you would not give this Occasion for the Word.</p>
<p class="indent">Said my Lady, Don’t be surpriz’d, Nephew; the Wench could not talk thus, if she had not been her Master’s Bed-fellow.—<em class="calibre6">Pamela, Pamela</em>, said she, and tapp’d me upon the Shoulder, two or three times, in Anger, thou hast lost thy Innocence, Girl; and thou hast got some of thy bold Master’s Assurance, and art fit to go any-whither.—Then, and please your Ladyship, said I, I am unworthy of your Presence, and desire I may quit it.</p>
<p class="indent">No, reply’d she, I will know first what Reason you can give for not accepting my Proposal, if you are innocent? I can give, said I, a very good one; but I beg to be excus’d. I will hear it, said she. Why then, answer’d I, I should perhaps have less Reason to like this Gentleman, than where I am.</p>
<p class="indent">Well then, said she, I’ll put you to another Trial. I’ll set out this Moment with you to your Father and Mother, and give you up safe to them. What do you say to that?—Ay, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said her Nephew, now what does your Innocence say to that?—’Fore Gad, Madam, you have puzzled her now.</p>
<p class="indent">Be pleas’d, Madam, said I, to call off this fine Gentleman. Your <a id="page_385"></a>Kindness in these Proposals makes me hope you will not have me baited. I’ll be d——said he, if she does not make me a Bull-dog! Why she’ll toss us all by-and-by! Sir, said I, you indeed behave as if you were in a Bear-garden.<a id="exp-note_89"></a><a href="part0021_split_089.html#exp-note-89" class="nounder">*</a></p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre6">Jackey</em>, be quiet, said my Lady. You only give her a Pretence to evade my Questions. Come, answer me, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>. I will, Madam, said I, and it is thus: I have no Occasion to be beholden to your Ladyship for this Honour; for I am to set out to-morrow Morning on the Way to my Parents.—Now again, thou lyest, Wench.—I am not of Quality, said I, to answer to such Language.—Once again, said she, provoke me not, by these Reflections, and this Pertness; if thou dost, I shall do something by thee unworthy of myself. That, thinks I, you have done already; but I ventur’d not to say so. But who is to carry you, said she, to your Father and Mother? Who my Master pleases, Madam, said I. Ay, said she, I doubt not, thou wilt do every thing he pleases, if thou hast not already. Why now tell me, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, from thy Heart, hast thou not been in Bed with thy Master? Ha, Wench!—I was quite shock’d at this, and said, I wonder how your Ladyship can use me thus!—I am sure you can expect no Answer; and my Sex, and my tender Years, might exempt me from such Treatment, with a Person of your Ladyship’s Birth and Quality, and who, be the Distance ever so great, is of the same Sex with me.</p>
<p class="indent">Thou art a confident Wench, said she, I see!—Pray, Madam, said I, let me beg you to permit me to go. I am waited for in the Town to Dinner. No, reply’d she, I can’t spare you, and whoever you are to go to, will excuse you, when they are told ’tis I that commands you not to go;—and you may excuse it too, young Lady <em class="calibre6">Wou’d-be</em>,<a id="exp-note_90"></a><a href="part0021_split_090.html#exp-note-90" class="nounder">*</a> if you consider that ’tis the unexpected Coming of your late Lady’s Daughter, and your Master’s Sister, that commands your Stay.</p>
<p class="indent">But a Pre-engagement, your Ladyship will consider, is something!—Ay, so it is; but I know not what Reason Waiting-maids have to assume these Airs of <em class="calibre6">Pre-engagements!</em>—Oh <em class="calibre6">Pamela, Pamela</em>, I am sorry for thy thus aping thy Betters, and giving thyself such Airs; I see thou’rt quite spoil’d! Of a modest, innocent Girl, that thou wast, and humble too, thou now art fit for nothing in the World, but what I fear thou art.</p>
<p class="indent">Why, please your Ladyship, said her Kinsman, what signifies all you say? The Matter’s over with her, no doubt; and she likes it; and she is in a Fairy-dream, and ’tis pity to awaken her before her <a id="page_386"></a>Dream’s out.—Bad as you take me to be, Madam, said I, I am not used to such Language or Reflections as this Gentleman gives me; and I won’t bear it.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, <em class="calibre6">Jackey</em>, said she, be silent; and shaking her Head, Poor Girl, said she!—What a sweet Innocence is here destroy’d!—A thousand Pities!—I could cry over her, if that would do her good! But she is quite lost, quite undone; and then has assum’d a Carriage upon it, that all those Creatures are distinguish’d by!—</p>
<p class="indent">I cry’d sadly for Vexation; and said, Say what you please, Madam: If I can help it, I will not answer another Word.—</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> came in, and ask’d, If her Ladyship was ready for Dinner. She said, Yes. I would have gone out with her; but my Lady said, taking my Hand, she could not spare me. And, Miss, said she, you may pull off your Gloves, and lay your Fan by, for you shan’t go; and if you behave well, you shall wait upon me at Dinner, and then I shall have a little further Talk with you.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> said to me, Madam, may I speak one Word with you?—I can’t tell, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, said I; for my Lady holds my Hand, and you see I am a kind of Prisoner.</p>
<p class="indent">What you have to say, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, said she, you may speak before me. But she went out, and seem’d vex’d for me; and she says, I look’d like the very Scarlet.</p>
<p class="indent">The Cloth was laid in another Parlour, and for three Persons, and she led me in: Come, my little Dear, said she, with a Sneer, I’ll hand you in, and I wou’d have you think it as well as if it was my Brother.</p>
<p class="indent">What a sad Case, thought I, should I be in, if I were as naughty as she thinks me! It was bad enough as it was.</p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre6">Jackey</em>, said my Lady, come, let us go to Dinner. She said to her Woman, Do you, <em class="calibre6">Beck</em>, help <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> to ’tend us; we will have no Men-fellows.—Come, my young Lady, shall I help you off with your white Gloves?—I have not, Madam, said I, deserv’d this at your Ladyship’s Hands.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> coming in with the first Dish, she said, Do you expect any body else, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, that you lay the Cloth for three?—Said she, I hop’d your Ladyship and Madam would have been so well reconcil’d, that she would have sat down too.—What means the clownish Woman? said my Lady, in great Disdain: Could you think the Creature should sit down with me.—She does, Madam, and please your Ladyship, with my Master.—I doubt it not, good <a id="page_387"></a>Woman, said she, and lyes with him too, does she not? Answer me, Fat-face!—How these Ladies are privileg’d!</p>
<p class="indent">If she does, Madam, said she, there may be a Reason for it, perhaps! And went out.—So, said she, has the Wench got thee over too!—Come, my little Dear, pull off thy Gloves, I say; and off she pull’d my Left Glove herself, and ’spy’d my Ring. O my dear God! said she, if the Wench has not got a Ring!—Well, this is a pretty Piece of Foolery, indeed! Dost know, my Friend, that thou art miserably trick’d!—And so, poor Innocent, thou hast made a fine Exchange, hast thou not? Thy Honesty for this Bauble! And I’ll warrant, my little Dear has topp’d her Part, and paraded it like any real Wife; and so mimicks still the Condition!—Why, said she, and turn’d me round, thou art as mincing as any Bride! No wonder thou art thus trick’d out, and talkest of thy <em class="calibre6">Pre-engagements!</em> Pr’ythee, Child, walk before me to that Glass, survey thyself, and come back to me, that I may see how finely thou canst act the Theatrical Part given thee!</p>
<p class="indent">I was then resolv’d to try to be silent; although most sadly vex’d.—So I went and sat me down in the Window, and she took her Place at the upper End of the Table; and her sawcy <em class="calibre6">Jackey</em>, fleering at me most provokingly, sat down by her.—Said he, Shall not the Bride sit down by us, Madam? Ay, well thought of, said my Lady: Pray, Mrs. Bride, your Pardon for sitting down in your Place?—I said nothing.</p>
<p class="indent">Said she, with a poor Pun, Thou hast some Modesty, however, Child! For thou canst not <em class="calibre6">stand it</em>, so must <em class="calibre6">sit down</em>, tho’ in my Presence!—I still kept my Seat, and said nothing.—Thinks I, this is a sad Thing, and I am hinder’d too from shewing my Duty where it is most due, and shall have Anger there too, may-be, if my dear Master should be there before me!—So she eat some Soup, as did her Kinsman; and then as she was cutting up a Fowl, said, If thou <em class="calibre6">long’st</em>, my little Dear, I will help thee to a Pinion, or Breast, or any thing. But may-be, Child, said he, thou likest the Rump, shall I bring it thee? And then laugh’d like an Idiot, for all he is a Lord’s Son, and may be a Lord himself.—For he is the Son of the Lord——; and his Mother, who was Lord <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>’s Sister, being dead, he has receiv’d what Education he has, from Lord <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>’s Direction. Poor Wretch! for all his Greatness! he’ll ne’er die for a Plot,—at least of his own hatching. If I could then have gone up, I would have given you his <a id="page_388"></a>Picture. But for one of 25 or 26 Years of Age, much about the Age of my dear Master, he is a most odd Mortal.</p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said my Lady, help me to a Glass of Wine. No, <em class="calibre6">Beck</em>, said she, you shan’t; for she was offering to do it. I will have my Lady Bride confer that Honour upon me; and then I shall see if she can <em class="calibre6">stand up</em>. I was silent, and never stirr’d.</p>
<p class="indent">Dost hear, <em class="calibre6">Chastity?</em> said she. Help me to a Glass of Wine, when I bid thee.—What! not stir! Then I’ll come and help thee to one. Still I stirr’d not, and fanning myself, continu’d silent. Said she, When I have ask’d thee, Meek-ones, half a dozen Questions together, I suppose thou wilt answer them all at once! Pretty Creature, is not that it?</p>
<p class="indent">I was so vex’d, I bit a Piece of my Fan out, not knowing what I did; but still I said nothing, and did nothing but flutter it, and fan myself.</p>
<p class="indent">I believe, said she, my next Question will make up half a dozen; and then, Modest-ones, I shall be intitled to an Answer.</p>
<p class="indent">He arose, and brought the Bottle and Glass, Come, said he, Mrs. Bride, be pleas’d to help my Lady, and I will be your Deputy. Sir, reply’d I, it is in a good Hand; help my Lady yourself.—Why, Creature, said she, dost thou think thyself above it?—And then flew into a Passion, Insolence! continued she, this Moment, when I bid you, know your Duty, and give me a Glass of Wine; or—</p>
<p class="indent">So, I took a little Spirit then—thinks I, I can but be beat—If, said I, to attend your Ladyship at Table, or even kneel at your Feet, was requir’d of me, I would most gladly do it, were I only the Person you think me; but, if it be to triumph over one who has received Honours, that she thinks requires her to act another Part, not to be utterly unworthy of them, I must say, I cannot do it.</p>
<p class="indent">She seem’d quite surpriz’d, and look’d now upon her Kinsman, and then upon her Woman.—I’m astonish’d! I’m quite astonish’d!—Well then, I suppose you would have me conclude you my Brother’s Wife; wou’d you not?</p>
<p class="indent">Your Ladyship, said I, compels this from me!—Well, return’d she, but dost thou thyself think thou art so?—Silence, said her Kinsman, gives Consent. ’Tis plain enough she does. Shall I rise, Madam, and pay my Duty to my new Aunt?</p>
<p class="indent">Tell me, said my Lady, what, in the Name of Impudence, possesses thee, to dare to look upon thyself as my Sister?—Madam, reply’d I, that is a Question will better become your most worthy Brother to answer, than me?</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_389"></a>She was rising in great Wrath; but her Woman said, Good your Ladyship; you’ll do yourself more Harm, than her; and if the poor Girl has been deluded so, as you have heard, with the Sham-marriage, she’ll be more deserving of your Ladyship’s Pity than Anger. True, <em class="calibre6">Beck</em>, very true, said my Lady; but there’s no bearing the Impudence of the Creature mean-time.</p>
<p class="indent">I would have gone out at the Door, but her Kinsman run and set his Back against it. I expected bad Treatment from her Pride and violent Temper; but this was worse than I could have thought of. And I said to him, Sir, when my Master comes to know your rude Behaviour, you will, may-be, have Cause to repent it. And went and sat down in the Window again.</p>
<p class="indent">Another Challenge, by Gad! said he; but I am glad she says her <em class="calibre6">Master!</em>—You see, Madam, she herself does not believe she is marry’d, and so has not been so much deluded as you think for. And coming to me with a most barbarous Air of Insult, he said, kneeling on one Knee before me, My new Aunt, your <em class="calibre6">Blessing</em>, or your <em class="calibre6">Curse</em>, I care not which; but quickly give me one or other, that I may not lose my Dinner!</p>
<p class="indent">I gave him a most contemptuous Look: Tinsel’d Toy, said I, (for he was lac’d all over) Twenty or Thirty Years hence, when you are <em class="calibre6">at Age</em>, I shall know how to answer you better; mean-time, sport with your Footmen, and not me! And so I remov’d to another Window nearer the Door, and he look’d like a sad Foolish, as he is.</p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre6">Beck, Beck</em>, said my Lady, this is not to be borne! Was ever the like heard! Is my Kinsman and Lord <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>’s to be thus used by such a Slut? And was coming to me: And indeed I began to be afraid; for I have but a poor Heart, after all. But Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, hearing high Words, came in again, with the second Course, and said, Pray your Ladyship, don’t so discompose yourself. I am afraid this Day’s Business will make Matters wider than ever between your good Ladyship and your Brother: For my Master doats upon Madam.</p>
<p class="indent">Woman, said she, do thou be silent! Sure, I, that was born in this House, may have some Privilege in it, without being talk’d to by the saucy Servants in it!</p>
<p class="indent">I beg Pardon, Madam, reply’d Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>; and turning to me, said, Madam, my Master will take it very ill, if you make him wait for you thus. So I rose to go out; but my Lady said, If it was only for <em class="calibre6">that</em> Reason, she shan’t go.—And went to the Door, and shut it, and <a id="page_390"></a>said to Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, Woman, don’t come again till I call you; and coming to me, took my Hand, and said, Find your Legs, Miss, if you please.</p>
<p class="indent">I stood up, and she tapp’d my Cheek! Oh! says she, that scarlet Glow shews what a rancorous little Heart thou hast, if thou durst shew it; but come this way. And so led me to her Chair: Stand there, said she, and answer me a few Questions while I dine, and I’ll dismiss thee, till I call thy impudent Master to Account; and then I’ll have you Face to Face, and all this Mystery of Iniquity shall be unravell’d; for, between you, I will come to the Bottom of it.</p>
<p class="indent">When she had sat down, I mov’d to the Window on the other Side the Parlour, looking into the private Garden; and her Woman said, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, don’t make my Lady angry. Stand by her Ladyship, as she bids you. Said I, Pray, good now, let it suffice you to attend your <em class="calibre6">Lady</em>’s Commands, and don’t lay <em class="calibre6">yours</em> upon <em class="calibre6">me</em>.—Your Pardon, sweet Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said she. Times are much alter’d with you, I’ll assure you! Said I, Her Ladyship has a very good Plea to be free in the House that she was <em class="calibre6">born</em> in. But you may as well confine your Freedoms to the House in which you had your <em class="calibre6">Breeding</em>. Why, how now, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said she! Since you provoke me to it, I’ll tell you a Piece of my Mind. Hush, hush, <em class="calibre6">good Woman</em>, said I, alluding to my Lady’s Language to Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>; my Lady wants not your Assistance!—Besides, I can’t scold!</p>
<p class="indent">The Woman was ready to stutter with Vexation; and Lord <em class="calibre6">Jackey</em> laugh’d as if he would burst his Sides; G—d—me, <em class="calibre6">Beck</em>, said he, you’d better let her alone to my Lady here; for she’ll be too many for twenty such as you and I.—And then he laugh’d again, and repeated—<em class="calibre6">I can’t scold</em>, quoth-a! but, by Gad, Miss, you can speak d—d spightful Words, I can tell you that!—Poor <em class="calibre6">Beck!</em> poor <em class="calibre6">Beck!</em>—’Fore Gad, she’s quite dumb-founder’d!</p>
<p class="indent">Well, but, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said my Lady, come hither, and tell me truly: Dost thou think thyself really marry’d?—Said I, and approach’d her Chair, My good Lady, I will answer all your Commands, if you’ll have Patience with me, and not be so angry as you are; but I can’t bear to be us’d thus by this Gentleman, and your Ladyship’s Woman. Child, said she, thou art very impertinent to my Kinsman; thou can’st not be civil to me; and my Ladyship’s Woman is much thy Betters. But that’s not the Thing!—Dost thou think thou art really marry’d?</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_391"></a>I see, Madam, said I, you are resolv’d not to be pleas’d with <em class="calibre6">any</em> Answer I shall return: If I should say, I am not, then your Ladyship will call me hard Names, and perhaps I should tell a Fib. If I should say, I am, your Ladyship will ask how I have the Impudence to be so,—and will call it a Sham-marriage. I will, said she, be answer’d more directly. Why, what, and please your Ladyship, does it signify what I think? Your Ladyship will believe as you please.</p>
<p class="indent">But canst thou have the Vanity, the Pride, the Folly, said she, to think thyself actually marry’d to <em class="calibre6">my</em> Brother? He is not Fool, Child; and Libertine enough of Conscience; and thou art not the first in the List of his credulous Harlots.—Well, well, said I, (and was in a sad Flutter) as I am easy and pleas’d with my Lot, pray your Ladyship let me continue so, as long as I can. It will be Time enough for me to know the worst, when the worst comes. And if it will be so bad, your Ladyship should pity me, rather than thus torment me before my Time.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, said she, but dost not think I am concern’d that a young Wench, whom my poor dear Mother lov’d so well, should thus cast herself away, and suffer herself to be deluded and undone, after such a noble Stand as thou mad’st for so long a Time?</p>
<p class="indent">I think myself far from being deluded and undone, and please your Ladyship, and am as innocent and virtuous as ever I was in my Life. Thou lyest, Child, said she. So your Ladyship told me <em class="calibre6">twice</em> before!</p>
<p class="indent">She gave me a Slap on the Hand for this; and I made a low Curchee, and said, I humbly thank your Ladyship!—but I could not refrain Tears. And added, Your dear Brother, Madam, however, won’t thank your Ladyship for this Usage of me, tho’ I do. Come a little nearer me, my Dear, said she, and thou shalt have a little more than <em class="calibre6">that</em> to tell him of, if thou think’st thou hast not made Mischief enough already between a Sister and Brother. But, Child, if he was here, I would serve thee worse, and him too. I wish he was, said I.—Dost thou threaten me, Mischief-maker, and insolent as thou art?</p>
<p class="indent">Now, pray your Ladyship, said I, (but got to a little Distance) be pleas’d to reflect upon all that you have said to me, since I have had the <em class="calibre6">Honour</em>, or rather <em class="calibre6">Misfortune</em>, to come into your Presence; whether you have said <em class="calibre6">one</em> Thing befitting your Ladyship’s Degree to me, even supposing I was the Wench, and the Creature, you suppose me to be?—Come hither, my pert Dear, reply’d she; come <a id="page_392"></a>but within my Reach for one Moment, and I’ll answer thee as thou deservest.</p>
<p class="indent">To be sure she meant to box my Ears. But I should be unworthy of my happy Lot, if I could not shew some Spirit.</p>
<p class="indent">When the Cloth was taken away, I said, I suppose I may now depart your Presence, Madam? I suppose not, said she. Why, I’ll lay thee a Wager, Child, thy Stomach’s too full to eat, and so thou may’st fast till thy mannerly Master comes home.</p>
<p class="indent">Pray your Ladyship, said her Woman, let the poor Girl sit down at Table with Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> and me.—Said I, you are very kind, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Worden</em>; but Times, as you said, are much alter’d with me; and I have been of late so much honour’d by better Company, that I can’t stoop to yours.</p>
<p class="indent">Was ever such Confidence, said my Lady! Poor <em class="calibre6">Beck</em>, poor <em class="calibre6">Beck</em>, said her Kinsman; why, she beats you quite out of the Pit!<a id="exp-note_91"></a><a href="part0021_split_091.html#exp-note-91" class="nounder">*</a>—Will your Ladyship, said I, be pleased to tell me how long I am to tarry? For you’ll please to see by that Letter, that I am oblig’d to attend my Master’s Commands. And so I gave her the dear Gentleman’s Letter from Mr. <em class="calibre6">Carlton</em>’s, which I thought would make her use me better, as she might judge by it of the Honour done me by him. Ay, said she, this is my worthy Brother’s Hand. It is directed to Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Andrews</em>. That’s to you, I suppose, Child? And so she read on, making Remarks as she went along, in this manner:<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre6">MY dearest</em> P<small class="calibre2">AMELA</small>,—‘Mighty well!’—<em class="calibre6">I hope my not coming home this Night will not frighten you!</em>—‘Vastly tender, indeed!—And did it frighten you, Child!’—<em class="calibre6">You may believe I can’t help it</em>. ‘No, to be sure!—A Person in thy Way of Life, is more tenderly used than an honest Wife. But mark the End of it!’—<em class="calibre6">I could have wish’d</em>, ‘Prythee, <em class="calibre6">Jackey</em>, mind this,’ <em class="calibre6">we</em> ‘mind the significant <em class="calibre6">We,’ had not engaged to the good Neighbourhood, at Sir</em> Simon’s <em class="calibre6">for to-morrow Night</em>.—‘Why, does the good Neighbourhood, and does Sir <em class="calibre6">Simon</em>, permit thy Visits, Child? They shall have none of mine then, I’ll assure them!’ <em class="calibre6">But I am so desirous to set out on</em> Wednesday <em class="calibre6">for the other House</em>—‘So, <em class="calibre6">Jackey</em>, we but just nick’d it, I find.’—<em class="calibre6">that, as well as in Return for the Civilities of so many good Friends, who will be there on purpose, I would not put it off</em>.—‘Now mind, <em class="calibre6">Jackey</em>.’—<em class="calibre6">What I beg of you</em>,—‘Mind the Wretch, that could use me and your Uncle, as he has done; he is turn’d Beggar to this Creature!’ <em class="calibre6">I beg of you, therefore, my Dear</em>, ‘My <a id="page_393"></a><em class="calibre6">Dear!</em> there’s for you!—I wish I may not be quite sick before I get thro’.’—<em class="calibre6">What I beg of you, therefore, my Dear</em>, [and then she look’d me full in the Face] <em class="calibre6">is, that you will go in the Chariot to Sir</em> Simon’s, <em class="calibre6">the sooner in the Day, the better</em>;—‘Dear Heart! and why so, when W<small class="calibre2">E</small> were not expected till Night? Why, pray observe the Reason—Hem!’ [said she] <em class="calibre6">Because you will be diverted with the Company</em>; ‘Mighty kind indeed!’—<em class="calibre6">who all, Jackey, Jackey</em>, mind this,’—<em class="calibre6">who all so much admire you</em>. ‘Now he’d ha’ been hang’d to have said so complaisant a thing, had he been marry’d, I’m sure!’—‘Very true, Aunt, said he: A plain Case that!’—[Thinks I, that’s hard upon poor Matrimony, tho’. I hope my Lady don’t find it so. But I durst not speak out.] <em class="calibre6">Who all so much admire you</em>, [said she] ‘I must repeat that—Pretty Miss—I wish thou wast as <em class="calibre6">admirable</em> for thy Virtue, as for that Baby-face of thine!’—<em class="calibre6">And I hope to join you there by your Tea-time, in the Afternoon!</em>—‘So, you’re in very good Time, Child, an Hour or two hence, to answer all your important Pre-engagements P—<em class="calibre6">which will be better than going home, and returning with you; as it will be six Miles Difference to me; and I know the good Company will excuse my Dress on the Occasion</em>. ‘Very true, any Dress is good enough, I’m sure, for such Company as <em class="calibre6">admire</em> thee, Child, for a Companion in thy ruin’d State!—<em class="calibre6">Jackey, Jackey</em>, mind, mind again! more fine things still.’ <em class="calibre6">I count every Hour of this little Absence for a Day</em>;—‘There’s for you! Let me repeat it,’ <em class="calibre6">I count every Hour of this little Absence for a Day!</em>—‘Mind too the Wit of the good Man! One may see Love is a new thing to him. Here is a very tedious time gone since he saw his Deary; no less than, according to <em class="calibre6">his</em> amorous Calculation, a Dozen Days and Nights, at least! and yet, <small class="calibre2">TEDIOUS</small> as it is, it is but a <small class="calibre2">LITTLE</small> A<small class="calibre2">BSENCE</small>. Well said, my good accurate and consistent Brother.—But wise Men in Love, are always the greatest Simpletons!—But now comes the Reason, why this <small class="calibre2">LITTLE</small> Absence, which, at the same time, is so <small class="calibre2">GREAT</small> an Absence, is so <em class="calibre6">tedious</em>:’ F<small class="calibre2">OR</small> <em class="calibre6">I am</em>, ‘Ay, now for it!’—<em class="calibre6">with the utmost Sincerity, My dearest Love</em>, ‘Out upon <small class="calibre2">DEAREST</small> L<small class="calibre2">OVE</small>! I shall never love the Word again! Pray bid your Uncle never call me Dearest Love, <em class="calibre6">Jackey!</em>’—<em class="calibre6">For Ever Yours!</em>—‘But, Brother, thou lyest!—Thou knowest thou dost.—And so, my good Lady <em class="calibre6">Andrews</em>, or what shall I call you? Your <em class="calibre6">dearest Love</em> will be <em class="calibre6">for Ever Yours!</em> And hast thou the Vanity to believe this!—But stay, here is a Postscript. The poor Man knew not when to have done to his <em class="calibre6">dearest Love</em>.—He’s sadly in for’t, truly! Why, <em class="calibre6">his dearest Love</em>, <a id="page_394"></a>you are mighty happy in such a Lover!’—<em class="calibre6">If you could go to dine with them</em>,—‘Cry your Mercy, my <em class="calibre6">dearest Love</em>, now comes the Pre-engagement!’ <em class="calibre6">it will be a Freedom that will be very pleasing to them, and the more as they don’t expect it</em>.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">Well, so much for this kind Letter! But you see you cannot honour this admiring Company with this little-expected, and, but in Complaisance to his Folly, I dare say, little-desired Freedom. And I cannot forbear <em class="calibre6">admiring</em> you so much myself, my <em class="calibre6">dearest Love</em>, that I will not spare you at all, this whole Evening. For ’tis a little hard, if thy Master’s Sister may not be blest a little bit with thy charming Company.</p>
<p class="indent">So I found I had shewed her my Letter to very little Purpose, and repented it several times, as she read on.—Well then, I hope, said I, your Ladyship will give me Leave to send my Excuses to your good Brother, and say, that your Ladyship is come, and is so fond of me, that you will not let me leave you.—Pretty Creature! said she; and wantest thou thy good Master to come, and quarrel with his Sister on thy Account?—But thou shalt not stir from my Presence; and I would now ask thee, What it is thou meanest by shewing me this Letter?—Why, Madam, said I, to shew your Ladyship how I was engaged for this Day and Evening.—And for nothing else? said she. Why, I can’t tell, Madam, said I: But if you can collect from it any other Circumstances, I might hope I should be not the worse treated.</p>
<p class="indent">I saw her Eyes began to sparkle with Passion; and she took my Hand, and said, grasping it very hard, I know, confident Creature, that you shew’d it me to insult me!—You shew’d it me, to let me see, that he could be civiller to a Beggar-born, than to me, or to my good Lord <em class="calibre6">Davers!</em>—You shew’d it me, as if you’d have me as credulous a Fool as yourself, to believe your true Marriage, when I know the whole Trick of it, and have Reason to believe you do too; and you shew’d it me, to upbraid me with his stooping to such painted Dirt, to the Disgrace of a Family, ancient and untainted beyond most in the Kingdom; and now will I give thee One hundred Guineas for one bold Word, that I may fell thee at my Foot.</p>
<p class="indent">Was not this very dreadful! To be sure, I had better have kept the Letter from her. I was quite frighten’d!—And this fearful Menace, and her fiery Eyes, and rageful Countenance, made me lose all my Courage!—So I said, weeping, Good your Ladyship, pity me!—Indeed <a id="page_395"></a>I am honest; indeed I am virtuous; indeed I would not do a bad thing for the World.</p>
<p class="indent">Tho’ I know, said she, the whole Trick of thy pretended Marriage, and thy foolish Ring here, and all the rest of the wicked Nonsense; yet I should not have Patience with thee, if thou but offerest to let me know thy Vanity prompts thee to <em class="calibre6">believe</em> thou art marry’d to <em class="calibre6">my</em> Brother!—I could not bear the Thought!—So take care, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>; take care, beggarly Brat; take care.</p>
<p class="indent">Good your Ladyship, said I, spare my dear Parents. They are honest and industrious: They were once in a very creditable Way, and never were Beggars. Misfortunes may attend any body: And I can bear the cruellest Imputations on myself, because I know my Innocence; but upon such honest, industrious Parents, who lived thro’ the greatest Trials, without being beholden to any thing but God’s Blessing, and their own hard Labour; I cannot bear Reflection.</p>
<p class="indent">What! art thou setting up for a Family, Creature as thou art! God! give me Patience with thee! I suppose my Brother’s Folly for thee, and his Wickedness together, will, in a little while, occasion a Search at the Herald’s-office,<a id="exp-note_92"></a><a href="part0021_split_092.html#exp-note-92" class="nounder">*</a> to set out thy wretched Obscurity. Provoke me, I desire thou wilt. One hundred Guineas will I give thee, to say but thou thinkest thou art marry’d to my Brother!</p>
<p class="indent">Your Ladyship, I hope, won’t kill me. And since nothing I can say, will please; but your Ladyship is resolved to quarrel with me; since I must not say what I think, on one hand nor another, whatever your Ladyship designs by me, be pleased to do, and let me depart your Presence!</p>
<p class="indent">She gave me a Slap on the Hand, and reached to box my Ear; but Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> hearkening without, and her Woman too, they both came in at that Instant; and Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> said, pushing herself in between us, Your Ladyship knows not what you do. Indeed you don’t. My Master would never forgive me, if I suffer’d, in his House, one he so dearly loves, to be so used; and it must not be, tho’ you are Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>. Her Woman too interposed, and told her, I was not worth her Ladyship’s Anger. But she was like a Person beside herself.</p>
<p class="indent">I offer’d to go out, and Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> took my Hand, to lead me out: But her Kinsman set his Back against the Door, and put his Hand to his Sword, and said, I should not go, till his Aunt permitted it. He drew it half-way; and I was so terrified, that I cry’d out, Oh! the <a id="page_396"></a>Sword! the Sword! and, not knowing what I did, I run to my Lady herself, and clasp’d my Arms about her, forgetting, just then, how much she was my Enemy, and said, sinking on my Knees, Defend me, good your Ladyship! The Sword! the Sword!—Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> said, Oh! my Lady will fall into Fits; but Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> was, herself, so startled at the matter being carry’d so far, that she did not mind her Words, and said, <em class="calibre6">Jackey</em>, don’t draw your Sword!—You see, as great as her Spirit is, she can’t bear that.</p>
<p class="indent">Come, said she, be comforted; he shan’t fright you!—I’ll try to overcome my Anger, and will pity you. So, Wench, rise up, and don’t be foolish. Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> held her Salts to my Nose, and I did not faint. And my Lady said, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, if <em class="calibre6">you</em> would be forgiven, leave <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> and me by ourselves; and, <em class="calibre6">Jackey</em>, do you withdraw; only you, <em class="calibre6">Beck</em>, stay.</p>
<p class="indent">So I sat down in the Window, all in a sad Fluster; for, to be sure, I was sadly frighted.—Said her Woman, You should not sit in my Lady’s Presence, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>. Yes, let her sit till she is a little recover’d of her Fright, said my Lady, and set my Chair by her. And so she sat over-against me, and said, To be sure, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, you have been very provoking with your Tongue, to be sure you have, as well upon my Nephew, (who is a Man of Quality too) as me. And, palliating her cruel Usage, and beginning, I suppose, to think herself, she had carry’d it further than she could answer it to her Brother, she wanted to lay the Fault upon me; Own, said she, you have been very saucy, and beg my Pardon, and beg <em class="calibre6">Jackey</em>’s Pardon; and I will try to pity you: For you are a sweet Girl, after all;—if you had but held out, and been honest.</p>
<p class="indent">’Tis injurious to me, Madam, said I, to imagine I am not honest!—Said she, Have you not been a-bed with my Brother? tell me that.—Your Ladyship, reply’d I, asks your Questions in a strange Way, and in strange Words.</p>
<p class="indent">Oh! your Delicacy is wounded, I suppose, by my plain Question!—This Niceness will soon leave you Wench: It will indeed. But answer me directly. Said I, Then your Ladyship’s next Question will be, Am I marry’d? And you won’t bear my Answer to that,—and will beat me again.</p>
<p class="indent">I han’t beat you yet; have I, <em class="calibre6">Beck?</em> said she. So you want to make out a Story, do you?—But, indeed, I can’t bear thou should’st so much as <em class="calibre6">think</em> thou art <em class="calibre6">my</em> Sister. I know the whole Trick of it; and <a id="page_397"></a>so, ’tis my Opinion, dost thou. It is only thy little Cunning, that it may look like a Cloak to thy yielding, and get better Terms from him. Pr’ythee, pr’ythee, Wench, thou seest I know the World a little;—almost as much at Thirty-two, as thou dost at Sixteen.—Remember that!</p>
<p class="indent">I rose from the Window, and walking to the other End of the Room, Beat me again, if you please, said I; but I must tell your Ladyship, I scorn your Words, and am as much marry’d as your Ladyship!</p>
<p class="indent">At that she run to me, but her Woman interposed again; Let the vain wicked Creature go from your Presence, Madam, said she. She is not worthy to be in it. She will but vex your Ladyship. Stand away, <em class="calibre6">Beck</em>, said she. That’s an Assertion that I would not take from my Brother. I can’t bear it. As much marry’d as I!—Is that to be borne? But if the Creature believes she is, Madam, said her Woman, she is to be as much pity’d for her Credulity, as despised for her Vanity.</p>
<p class="indent">I was in hopes to have slipt out of the Door; but she caught hold of my Gown, and pulled me back. Pray your Ladyship, said I, don’t kill me!—I have done no Harm.—But she lock’d the Door, and put the Key in her Pocket. So seeing Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> before the Window, I lifted up the Sash, and said, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, I believe it would be best for the Chariot to go to your Master, and let him know, that Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> is here; and I cannot leave her Ladyship.</p>
<p class="indent">She was resolved to be displeased, let me say what I would. Said she, No, no; he’ll then think that I make the Creature my Companion, and know not how to part with her. I thought your Ladyship, reply’d I, could not have taken Exceptions at this Message. Thou knowest nothing, Wench, said she, of what belongs to People of Condition: How shouldst thou? Nor, thought I, do I desire it, at this Rate.</p>
<p class="indent">What shall I say, Madam? said I. Nothing at all, reply’d she; let him expect his <em class="calibre6">Dearest Love</em>, and be disappointed; it is but adding a few more <em class="calibre6">Hours</em>, and he will make every one <em class="calibre6">a Day</em>, in his amorous Account.—Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> coming nearer me, and my Lady walking about the Room, being then at the End, I whisper’d, Let <em class="calibre6">Robert</em> stay at the Elms; I’ll have a Struggle for’t by-and-by.</p>
<p class="indent">As much marry’d as I! repeated she.—The Insolence of the Creature!—And so she walk’d about the Room, talking to herself, to her Woman, and now-and-then to me; but seeing I could not please <a id="page_398"></a>her, I thought I had better be silent. And then it was, Am I not worthy an Answer? If I speak, said I, your Ladyship is angry at me, tho’ ever so respectfully; if I do not, I cannot please: Would your Ladyship tell me but how I shall oblige you, and I would do it with all my Heart?</p>
<p class="indent">Confess the Truth, said she, that thou’rt an undone Creature; hast been in Bed with thy Master; and art sorry for it, and for the Mischief thou hast occasion’d between him and me; and then I’ll pity thee, and persuade him to pack thee off, with a hundred or two of Guineas, and some honest Farmer may take Pity of thee, and patch up thy Shame, for the sake of the Money; and if nobody will have thee, thou must vow Penitence, and be as humble as I once thought thee.</p>
<p class="indent">I was quite sick at Heart, at all this passionate Extravagance, and to be hinder’d from being where was the Desire of my Soul, and afraid too of incurring my dear Master’s Displeasure; and, as I sat, I saw it was no hard matter to get out of the Window, into the Front-yard, the Parlour being even with the Yard, and so have a fair Run for it; and after I had seen my Lady at the other End of the Room again, in her Walks, having not pulled down the Sash, when I spoke to Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, I got upon the Seat, and whipt out in a Minute, and ran away as hard as I could drive, my Lady calling after me to return, and her Woman at the other Window: But two of her Servants appearing at her crying out, and she bidding them stop me, I said, Touch me at your Peril, Fellows; but their Lady’s Commands would have prevail’d on them, had not Mr. <em class="calibre6">Colbrand</em>, who, it seems, had been kindly order’d, by Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, to be within Call, when she saw how I was treated, come up, and put on one of his deadly fierce Looks, the only time, I thought, it ever became him, and said, He would <em class="calibre6">chine</em> the Man, that was his Word, who offer’d to touch his Lady; and so he run along-side of me; and I heard my Lady say, The Creature flies like a Bird! And, indeed, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Colbrand</em>, with his huge Strides, could hardly keep pace with me; and I never stopt till I got to the Chariot; and <em class="calibre6">Robert</em> had got down, seeing me running at a Distance, and held the Door in his Hand, with the Step ready down; and in I jumpt, without touching the Step, saying, Drive me, drive me, as fast as you can, out of my Lady’s Reach! And he mounted, and <em class="calibre6">Colbrand</em> said, Don’t be frighten’d, Madam; nobody shall hurt you.—And shut the Door, and away <em class="calibre6">Robert</em> drove; but I was quite out of Breath, and did not recover it, and my Fright, all the Way.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_399"></a>Mr. <em class="calibre6">Colbrand</em> was so kind, but I did not know it till the Chariot stopt at Sir <em class="calibre6">Simon</em>’s, to step up behind the Coach, lest, as he said, my Lady should send after me; and he told Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, when he got home, that he never saw such a Runner as me, in his Life.</p>
<p class="indent">When the Chariot stopt, which was not till Six o’Clock, so long did this cruel Lady keep me, Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em> run out to me; O, Madam, said she, ten times welcome! but you’ll be beat, I can tell you; for here has been the ’Squire come these two Hours, and is very angry at you.</p>
<p class="indent">That’s hard indeed, said I!—Indeed I can’t afford it!—for I hardly knew what I said, having not recover’d my Fright. Let me sit down, Miss, anywhere, said I; for I have been sadly off. So I sat down, and was quite sick with the Hurry of my Spirits, and lean’d upon her Arm.</p>
<p class="indent">Said she, Your Lord and Master came in very moody; and when he had staid an Hour, and you not come, he began to fret, and said, He did not expect so little Complaisance from you. And he is now sat down, with great Persuasions, to a Game at Loo.<a id="exp-note_93"></a><a href="part0021_split_093.html#exp-note-93" class="nounder">*</a>—Come, you must make your Appearance, Lady fair; for he’s too sullen to attend you, I doubt.</p>
<p class="indent">You have no Strangers, have you, Miss, said I?—Only two Women Relations from <em class="calibre6">Stamford</em>, reply’d she, and an humble Servant of one of them.—Only all the World, Miss! said I.—What shall I do, if he be angry? I can’t bear that.</p>
<p class="indent">Just as I had said so, came in Lady <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em> and Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em>, to chide me, as they said, for not coming sooner. And before I could speak, came in my dear Master. I ran to him. How d’ye, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said he, and saluted me, with a little more Formality than I could well bear.—I expected half a Word from me, when I was so complaisant to your Choice, would have determin’d you, and that you’d been here to Dinner;—and the rather, as I made my Request a reasonable one, and what, I thought, would be agreeable to you. O dear Sir, said I, pray, pray hear me, and you’ll pity me, and not be displeased: Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> will tell you, that as soon as I had your kind Commands, I said, I would obey you, and come to Dinner with these good Ladies; and so prepared myself instantly, with all the Pleasure in the World. Lady <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em> and Miss said, I was their Dear!—Look you, said Miss, did I not tell you, Stately-ones, that something must have happen’d? But O these Tyrants! these Men!</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_400"></a>Why, what hinder’d it, my Dear? said he: Give yourself Time; you seem out of Breath!—O Sir, said I, Out of Breath! well I may!—For, just as I was ready to come away, who should drive into the Courtyard, but Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers!</em>—Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers!</em> Nay, then, my sweet Dear, said he, and kissed me more tenderly, hast thou had a worse Trial than I wish thee, from one of the haughtiest Women in <em class="calibre6">England</em>, tho’ my Sister!—For she, too, my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, was spoiled by my good Mother!—But have you seen her?</p>
<p class="indent">Yes, Sir, said I, and more than seen her!—Why, sure, said he, she has not had the Insolence to strike my Girl!—Sir, said I, but tell me you forgive me; for indeed I could not come sooner; and these good Ladies but excuse me; and I’ll tell you all another time; for to take up the good Company’s Attention now, will spoil their Pleasantry, and be to them, tho’ more important to me, like the Lady’s broken China, you caution’d me about.</p>
<p class="indent">That’s a dear Girl! said he; I see my Hints are not thrown away upon you; and I beg Pardon for being angry at you; and, for the future, will stay till I hear your Defence before I judge you. Said Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em>, This is a little better! To own a Fault, is some Reparation; and what every lordly Husband will not do. He said, But tell me, my Dear, Did Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> offer you any Incivility? O Sir, reply’d I, she is your Sister, and I must not tell you all; but she has used me very severely. Did you tell her, said he, you was marry’d?—Yes, Sir, I did at last: But she will have it, ’tis a Sham-marriage, and that I am a vile Creature: And she was ready to beat me, when I said so; for she could not have Patience that I should be deem’d her Sister, as she said.</p>
<p class="indent">How unlucky it was, reply’d he, I was not at home?—Why did you not send to me here? Send, Sir! I was kept Prisoner by Force. They would not let me stir, or do you think, I would have been hinder’d from obeying you? Nay, I told them, that I had a Pre-engagement; but she ridiculed me, and said, Waiting-maids talk of Pre-engagements! and then I shew’d her your kind Letter; and she made a thousand Remarks upon it, and made me wish I had not. In short, whatever I could do or say, there was no pleasing her; and I was a <em class="calibre6">Creature</em>, and <em class="calibre6">Wench</em>, and all that was naught. But you must not be angry with her, on my Account.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, but, said he, I suppose she hardly asked you to dine with her; for she came before Dinner, I suppose, if it was soon after you had <a id="page_401"></a>received my Letter? No, Sir, dine with my <em class="calibre6">Lady!</em> no indeed! Why, she would make me wait at Table upon her, with her Woman, because she would not expose herself and me before the Men-servants; which, you know, Sir, was very good of her Ladyship.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, said he, but <em class="calibre6">did</em> you wait at Table upon her? Would you have had me, Sir? said I.—Only, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, reply’d he, if you did, and knew not what belong’d to your Character, as my Wife, I shall be very angry with you. Sir, said I, I did not; but refused it, out of Consideration of the Dignity you have raised me to; else, Sir, I could have waited on my Knees upon your Sister.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, said he, you confirm my Opinion of your Prudence and Judgment. She is an insolent Woman, and shall dearly repent it. But, Sir, she is to be excus’d, because she won’t believe I am indeed marry’d; so don’t be too angry at her Ladyship.</p>
<p class="indent">He said, Ladies, pray don’t let us keep you from the Company; I’ll only ask a Question or two more, and attend you. Said Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em>, I so much long to hear this Story of poor Madam’s Persecution, that if it was not improper, I should be glad to stay. Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em> would stay for the same Reason; my Master saying, he had no Secrets to ask, and that it was kind of them to interest themselves in my Grievances.</p>
<p class="indent">But Lady <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em> went in to the Company, and told them the Cause of my Detention; for, it seems, my dear Master loved me too well, to keep to himself the Disappointment my not being here to receive him, had given him; and they had all given the two Miss <em class="calibre6">Boroughs</em>’s, and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Perry</em>, the <em class="calibre6">Stamford</em> Guests, such a Character of me, that they said they were impatient to see me.</p>
<p class="indent">Said my Master, But, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, you said, <em class="calibre6">They</em> and <em class="calibre6">Them</em>; Who had my Sister with her, besides her Woman? Her Nephew, Sir, and three Footmen on Horseback; and she and her Woman were in her Chariot and Six.</p>
<p class="indent">That’s a sad Coxcomb, said he: How did he behave to you?—Not extraordinarily, Sir; but I should not complain; for I was even with him; because I thought I ought not to bear with him as with my Lady.</p>
<p class="indent">By Heaven! said he, if I knew he behav’d unhandsomely to my Jewel, I’d send him home to his Uncle without his Ears. Indeed, Sir, return’d I, I was as hard upon him, as he was upon me. Said he, ’Tis kind to make the best for them. But I believe I shall make them <a id="page_402"></a>dearly repent their Visit, if I find their Behaviour to call for my Resentment.</p>
<p class="indent">But, sure, my Dear, you might have got away when you went to your own Dinner? Indeed, Sir, said I, her Ladyship locked me in, and would not let me stir.—So you han’t eat any Dinner? No, indeed, Sir, nor had a Stomach to any. My poor Dear! said he. But then, how got you away at last?—O, Sir, reply’d I, I jump’d out of the Parlour Window, and run away to the Chariot, which had waited for me several Hours, by the Elm-walk, from the Time of my Lady’s coming (for I was just going, as I said); and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Colbrand</em> saw me thro’ her Servants, whom she call’d to, to stop me; and was so kind to step behind the Chariot, unknown to me, and saw me safe here.</p>
<p class="indent">I’m sure, said he, these insolent Creatures must have treated you vilely. But tell me, What Part did Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> act in this Affair? A very kind Part, Sir, said I, in my Behalf; and I shall thank her for it. Sweet Creature, said he, thou makest the best for every body; but I hope she deserves it; for she knew you are married.—But come, we’ll now join the Company, and try to forget all you have suffer’d, for two or three Hours, that we may not fill the Company with our Concerns; and resume the Subject as we go home. And you shall find, I will do you Justice as I ought. But you forgive me, Sir, said I, and are not angry? Forgive you, my Dear! return’d he.—I hope you forgive me!—I shall never make you Satisfaction for what you have suffer’d <em class="calibre6">from</em> me, and <em class="calibre6">for</em> me! And with those Words, he led me into the Company.</p>
<p class="indent">He very kindly presented me to the two Stranger Ladies, and the Gentleman, and them to me; and Sir <em class="calibre6">Simon</em>, who was at Cards, rose from Table, and saluted me: Adad! Madam, said he, I’m glad to see you here. What, it seems you have been a Prisoner! ’Tis well you was, or your Spouse and I should have sat in Judgment upon you, and condemned you to a fearful Punishment for your first Crime of <em class="calibre6">Lœsœ Majestatis</em><a id="exp-note_94"></a><a href="part0021_split_094.html#exp-note-94" class="nounder">*</a> (I had this explained to me afterwards, as a sort of Treason against my Liege Lord and Husband). For we Husbands, hereabout, said he, are resolv’d to turn over a new Leaf with our Wives, and <em class="calibre6">your</em> Lord and Master shall shew us the Way, I can tell you that. But I see by your Eyes, my sweet Culprit, added he, and your Complection, you have had sour Sauce to your sweet Meat.</p>
<p class="indent">Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em> said, I think we are oblig’d to our sweet Guest, at <a id="page_403"></a>last; for she was forced to jump out at a Window to come to us. Indeed! said Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em>;—and my Master’s Back being turn’d, says she, Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>, when a Maiden, was always vastly passionate; but a very good Lady when it was over. And she’d make nothing of slapping her Maids about, and begging their Pardons afterwards, if they took it patiently; otherwise she used to say, The <em class="calibre6">Creatures</em> were even with her.</p>
<p class="indent">Ay, said I, I have been a many <em class="calibre6">Creatures</em> and <em class="calibre6">Wenches</em>, and I know not what; for these were the best of her Names. And I thought I ought to act up to the Part her dear Brother has given me; and so, truly, I have but just escaped a good Cuffing.</p>
<p class="indent">Miss <em class="calibre6">Boroughs</em> said to her Sister, as I heard, but she did not design it, What a sweet Creature is this! And then she takes so little upon her, is so free, so easy, and owns the Honour done her so obligingly! Said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Perry</em>, softly, The loveliest Person I ever saw! Who could have the Heart to be angry with her one Moment?</p>
<p class="indent">Says Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em>, Here, my dearest Neighbour, these Gentry are admiring you strangely; and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Perry</em> says, you are the loveliest Lady he ever saw; and says it to his own Mistress’s Face too, I’ll assure you—Or else, says Miss <em class="calibre6">Boroughs</em>, I should think he much flatter’d me.</p>
<p class="indent">O Miss, return’d I, you are exceedingly obliging; but your kind Opinion ought to learn me Humility, and to reverence so generous a Worth as can give a Preference against yourself, where it is so little due. Indeed, Madam, said Miss <em class="calibre6">Nanny Boroughs</em>, I love my Sister well; but it would be a high Compliment to any Lady, to be deem’d worthy of a second or third Place after you.</p>
<p class="indent">There is no answering such Politeness, said I: I am sure Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>, was very cruel to keep me from such kind Company. ’Twas our Loss, Madam, said Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em>. I’ll allow it, said I, in Degree, Miss; for you have all been deprived, several Hours, of an humble Admirer.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. <em class="calibre6">Perry</em> said, I never before saw so young a Lady shine forth with such Graces of Mind and Person. Alas! Sir, said I, my Master coming up, Mine is but a borrow’d Shine, like that of the Moon: Here is the Sun, to whose fervent Glow of Generosity I owe all the faint Lustre that your Goodness is pleased to look upon with so much kind Distinction.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. <em class="calibre6">Perry</em> was pleased to hold up his Hands; and the Ladies look’d <a id="page_404"></a>upon one another. And my Master said, hearing part of the last Sentence, What’s the pretty Subject, that my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> is displaying, so sweetly, her Talents upon?</p>
<p class="indent">Oh! Sir, said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Perry</em>, I will pronounce you the happiest Gentleman in <em class="calibre6">England</em>. And I, said Miss <em class="calibre6">Boroughs</em>; And I, said Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em>; And I, said each of the others.</p>
<p class="indent">My Master said, most generously, Thank ye, Thank ye, Thank ye, all round, my dear Friends. I know not your Subject; but if you believe me so, for a single Instance of this dear Girl’s Goodness, what must I think myself, when blest with a thousand Instances, and experiencing it in every single Act and Word! I do assure you, my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>’s Person, all lovely as you see it, is far short of her Mind; That first impress’d me in her Favour; but that only made me her <em class="calibre6">Lover</em>: But they were the Beauties of her Mind, that made me her <em class="calibre6">Husband</em>; and proud, my sweet Dear, said he, pressing my Hand, am I of that Title.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Perry</em>, very kindly and politely, Excellent as your Lady is, I know not the Gentleman that could deserve her, but that one, who could say such just and such fine things.</p>
<p class="indent">I was all abash’d; and took Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em>’s Hand, and said, Save me, dear Miss, by your sweet Example, from my rising Pride. But could I deserve half these kind things, what a happy Creature should I be! Said Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em>, You deserve them all, indeed you do.</p>
<p class="indent">The greatest Part of the Company being sat down to Loo, my Master being press’d, said, he would take one Game at Whist;<a id="exp-note_95"></a><a href="part0021_split_095.html#exp-note-95" class="nounder">*</a> but had rather be excused too, having been up all Night; and I asked how his Friend did? We’ll talk of that, said he, another time; which, and his Seriousness, made me fear the poor Gentleman was dead, as it prov’d.</p>
<p class="indent">We cast in, and Miss <em class="calibre6">Boroughs</em> and my Master were together, and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Perry</em> and I; and I had all four Honours the first time, and we were up at one Deal. Said my Master, An honourable Hand, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, should go with an honourable Heart; but you’d not have been up, if a Knave had not been one. Whist, Sir, said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Perry</em>, you know, was a Court Game originally, and the Knave, I suppose, signified always the prime Minister.<a id="exp-note_96"></a><a href="part0021_split_096.html#exp-note-96" class="nounder">*</a></p>
<p class="indent">’Tis well, said my Master, if now there is but One Knave in a Court, out of Four Persons, take the Court thro’.</p>
<p class="indent">The King and Queen, Sir, said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Perry, can</em> do no Wrong, you <a id="page_405"></a>know. So there are Two that <em class="calibre6">must</em> be good out of Four; and the Ace seems too plain a Card to mean much Hurt.</p>
<p class="indent">We compliment the King, said my Master, in that manner; and ’tis well to do so, because there is something sacred in the Character. But yet, if Force of Example be consider’d, it is going a great way; for certainly a good Master makes a good Servant, generally speaking.</p>
<p class="indent">One thing, added he, in regard to the Ace; I have always look’d upon that plain and honest-looking Card, in the Light you do. And have consider’d Whist as an <em class="calibre6">English</em> Game in its Original; which has made me fonder of it than of any other. For, by the Ace, I have always thought the Laws of the Land denoted; and, as the Ace is above the King or Queen, and wins them; I think the Law should be thought so too; tho’, may-be, I shall be deem’d a <em class="calibre6">Whig</em> for my Opinion.</p>
<p class="indent">I shall never play at Whist, said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Perry</em>, without thinking of this, and shall love the Game the better for the Thought; tho’ I am no Party-man. Nor I, said my Master; for I think the Distinctions of <em class="calibre6">Whig</em> and <em class="calibre6">Tory</em> odious; and love the one or the other, only as they are honest and worthy Men; and have never, (nor ever shall, I hope) given a Vote, but according to what I thought was for the publick Good, let either <em class="calibre6">Whig</em> or <em class="calibre6">Tory</em> propose it.<a id="exp-note_97"></a><a href="part0021_split_097.html#exp-note-97" class="nounder">*</a></p>
<p class="indent">I wish, Sir, reply’d Mr. <em class="calibre6">Perry</em>, all Gentlemen, in your Station, would act so. If there was no undue Influence, said my Master, I am willing to think so well of all Mankind, that I believe they generally would.</p>
<p class="indent">But you see, said he, by my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>’s Hand, when all the Court-cards get together, and are acted by <em class="calibre6">one Mind</em>, the Game is usually turn’d accordingly. Tho’ now-and-then, too, it may be so circumstanced, that <em class="calibre6">Honours</em> will do them no Good; and they are forced to depend altogether upon <em class="calibre6">Tricks</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">I thought this way of Talking prettier than the Game itself. But I said, Tho’ I have won the Game, I hope Sirs, I am no <em class="calibre6">Trickster</em>. No, said my Master, God forbid but <em class="calibre6">Court-cards</em> should <em class="calibre6">sometimes</em> win with <em class="calibre6">Honour!</em> But you see, for all that, your Game is as much owing to the <em class="calibre6">Knave</em>, as the <em class="calibre6">King</em>; and you, my Fair one, lost no Advantage, when it was put into your Power.</p>
<p class="indent">Else, Sir, said I, I should not have done Justice to my Partner: You are certainly right, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, reply’d he; tho’ you thereby beat your Husband. Sir, said I, You may be my Partner next, and I must do Justice, you know. Well, said he, always chuse so worthy a Friend, as <a id="page_406"></a>Chance has given you for a Partner, and I shall never find Fault with you, do what you will.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. <em class="calibre6">Perry</em> said, You are very good to me, Sir; and Miss <em class="calibre6">Boroughs</em>, I observed, seem’d pleas’d with the Compliment to her humble Servant; by which I saw she esteem’d him, as he seems to deserve. Dear-sirs! said I, how much better is this, than to be lock’d in by Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers?</em></p>
<p class="indent">The Supper was brought in sooner on my Account, because I had had no Dinner; and there passed very agreeable Compliments on the Occasion. Lady <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em> would help me first, because I had so long fasted, as she said. Sir <em class="calibre6">Simon</em> would have placed himself next me: And my Master said, he thought it was best, where there was an equal Number of Ladies and Gentlemen, that they should sit intermingled, that the Gentlemen might be employ’d in helping and serving the Ladies. Lady <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em> said, She hoped Sir <em class="calibre6">Simon</em> would not sit above any Ladies, at his own Table especially. Well, said he, I shall sit over-against her however; and that’s as well.</p>
<p class="indent">My dearest Sir could not keep his Eye off me, and seem’d generously to be delighted with all I did, and all I said; and every one was pleased to see his kind and affectionate Behaviour to me.</p>
<p class="indent">Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em> brought up the Discourse about Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> again; and my Master said, I fear, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, you have been hardly used, more than you’ll say. I know my Sister’s passionate Temper too well, to believe she could be over-civil to you, especially as it happen’d so unluckily that I was out. If, added he, she had had no Pique to you, my Dear, yet what has passed between her and me, has so exasperated her, that I know she would have quarrel’d with my <em class="calibre6">Horse</em>, if she had thought I valued it, and nobody else was in her way. Dear Sir, said I, don’t say so of good Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Said he, Why, my Dear, I know she came on purpose to quarrel; and had she not found herself under a very violent Uneasiness, after what had passed between us, and my Treatment of her Lord’s Letter, she would not have offer’d to come near me. What sort of Language had she for me, <em class="calibre6">Pamela?</em> O, Sir, very good, only <em class="calibre6">her well-manner’d Brother</em>, and such as that!</p>
<p class="indent">Only, said he, ’tis taking up the Attention of the Company disagreeably, or I could tell you almost every Word she said. Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em> wish’d to hear a further Account of my Lady’s Conduct, and most of the Company join’d with her, particularly Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em>; who said, <a id="page_407"></a>That as they knew the Story, and Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>’s Temper, tho’ she was very good in the main, they could wish to be so agreeably entertain’d, if he and I pleas’d; because they imagin’d I should have no Difficulties after this.</p>
<p class="indent">Tell me then, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said he, did she lift up her Hand at you? Did she strike you? But I hope not! A little Slap of the Hand, said I, or so!—Insolent Woman! She did not, I hope, offer to strike your Face? Why, said I, I was a little saucy once or twice, and she would have given me a Cuff on the Ear, if her Woman and Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> had not interpos’d. Why did you not come out at the Door? Because, said I, her Ladyship sat her Chair against it, one while, and another while lock’d it; else I offer’d, several times, to get away.</p>
<p class="indent">She knew I expected you here? You say, you shew’d her my Letter to you? Yes, Sir, said I; but I had better not; for she was then more exasperated, and made strange Comments upon it. I doubt it not, said he; but, did she not see, by the kind Epithets in it, that there was room to think we were marry’d? O, Sir, reply’d I, and made the Company smile, she said, For that very Reason, she was sure I was not marry’d.</p>
<p class="indent">That’s like my Sister! said he, exactly like her; and yet she lives very happily herself. For her poor Lord never contradicts her. Indeed he <em class="calibre6">dare</em> not.</p>
<p class="indent">You was a great many <em class="calibre6">Wenches</em>, was you not, my Dear? for that’s a great Word with her.—Yes, Sir, said I, <em class="calibre6">Wenches</em> and <em class="calibre6">Creatures</em> out of Number; and worse than all that. What? tell me, my Dear. Sir, said I, I must not have you angry with Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>. While you are so good to me, ’tis all nothing, only the Trouble that I cannot be suffer’d to shew how much I honour her Ladyship, as your Sister.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, said he, you need not be afraid to tell me: I must love her, after all; tho’ I shall not be pleas’d with her on this Occasion. And I know it is her mistaken Love for me, that makes her so uneasy; and, after all, she comes, I know, to be reconciled to me; tho’ it must be thro’ a good hearty Quarrel first. For she can shew a deal of Sunshine; but it must be always after a Storm. And I’ll love her dearly, if she has not been, and will not be, too hard upon my Dearest.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em> said, Sir, you are very good, and very kind. I love to see this Complaisance to your Sister, tho’ she be in Fault, so long as you can shew it with so much Justice to the sweetest Innocence and Merit in the World. By all that’s good, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em>, said he, I’d present my <a id="page_408"></a>Sister with One thousand Pounds, if she would kindly take my dear <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> by the Hand, and wish her Joy, and call her Sister!—And yet I should be unworthy of the dear Creature that smiles upon me there, if it was not principally for her sake, and the Pleasure it would give her, that I say this: For I will never be thoroughly reconciled to my Sister, till she does; for I most sincerely think, as to myself, that my dear Spouse, there she sits, does me more Honour in her new Relation, than she receives from me!</p>
<p class="indent">Sir, said I, I am overwhelm’d with your Goodness!—And my Eyes were filled with Tears of Joy and Gratitude. And all the Company, with one Voice, blessed him. And Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em> was pleased to say, The Company and Behaviour of you two happy Ones to each other, are the most edifying I ever knew. I am always improv’d when I see you. How happy would every good Lady be with such a Gentleman, and every good Gentleman with such a Lady!—In short, you seem made for one another.</p>
<p class="indent">O, Madam, said I, you are so kind, so good to me, that I know not how to thank you enough. Said she, You deserve more than I can express; for, to all who know your Story, you are a matchless Person. You are an Ornament to our Sex, and your Virtue, tho’ your dear Spouse is so excellent and generous as he is, has met with no more than its due Reward. And God long bless you together.</p>
<p class="indent">You are, said my dearest Sir, very good to me, Madam, I am sure. I have taken Liberties in my former Life, that deserved not so much Excellence. I have offended extremely, by Trials glorious to my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, but disgraceful to me, against a Virtue that I now consider as almost sacred; and I shall not think I deserve her, till I can bring my Manners, my Sentiments, and my Actions, to a Conformity with her own. And, in short, my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said he, I want you to be nothing but what you are, and have been. You cannot be better; and if you could, it would be but filling me with Despair to attain the awful Heights of Virtue, at which you are arrived. Perhaps, added the dear Gentleman, the Scene I have beheld within these twelve Hours, has made me more serious than otherwise I should have been; but I’ll assure you, before all this good Company, I speak the Sentiments of my Heart; and those not of this Day only.</p>
<p class="indent">What a happy Daughter is yours, O my dear Father and Mother! I owe it all to God’s Grace, and yours and my good Lady’s Instructions; and to these let me always look back with grateful Acknowledgments, <a id="page_409"></a>that I may not impute to myself, and be proud, my very great Happiness.</p>
<p class="indent">The Company were so kindly pleas’d with our Concerns, and my dear Master’s Goodness, that he observing their Indulgence, and being himself curious to know what had pass’d between my Lady and me, repeated his Question, What she had call’d me besides Wench and Creature? And I said, My Lady, supposing I was wicked, lamented over me very kindly, my Depravity and Fall, and said what a thousand Pities it was, so much Virtue, as she was pleas’d to say, was so destroy’d, and that I had yielded after so noble a Stand, as she said.</p>
<p class="indent">Excuse me, Gentlemen and Ladies, said I; you know my Story, it seems; and I am commanded by one, who has a Title to all my Obedience, to proceed.</p>
<p class="indent">They gave all of them Bows of Approbation, that they might not interrupt me; and I continued my Story.—</p>
<p class="indent">I told her Ladyship, continued I, that I was still innocent, and would be so, and it was injurious to suppose me otherwise! Why, tell me, Wench, said she,—but I think I must not tell you what she said. Yes, do, said my Master, to clear my Sister; we shall think it very bad else.</p>
<p class="indent">I held my Hand before my Face, and said, Why, she said, Tell me, Wench, hast thou not been a-bed with thy Master!—That she said.—And when I said, she ask’d strange Questions, and in strange Words, she ridicul’d my Delicacy, as she call’d it, and said my Niceness would not last long. She said, I must know I was not really marry’d, that my Ring was only a Sham, and all was my Cunning to cloak my yielding, and get better Terms: She said, she knew the World as much at Thirty-two, as I did at Sixteen; and bid me remember that.</p>
<p class="indent">I took the Liberty to say, (but I got a good way off) That I scorn’d her Ladyship’s Words, and was as much marry’d as her Ladyship. And then, Good-sirs, I had certainly been cuff’d, if her Woman had not interposed, and told her I was not worth her Anger; and that I was as much to be pitied for my Credulity, as despis’d for my Vanity.</p>
<p class="indent">My poor <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said my Master, this was too-too hard upon you! O Sir, said I, how much easier it was to me, than if it had been so!—That would have broke my Heart quite!—For then I should have <a id="page_410"></a>deserv’d it all, and worse; and these Reproaches, added to my own Guilt, would have made me truly wretched!</p>
<p class="indent">Lady <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em>, at whose Right-hand I sat, kissed me with a kind of Rapture, and call’d me a sweet Exemplar for all my Sex. Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em> said very handsome Things. So did Mr. <em class="calibre6">Perry</em>; and Sir <em class="calibre6">Simon</em> had Tears in his Eyes, and said to my Master, Why, Neighbour, Neighbour, this is excellent, by my Troth. I believe there is something in Virtue, that we had not well considered. On my Soul there has been but one Angel come down for these thousand Years, and you have got her.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, my Dearest, said my Master, pray proceed with your Story till we have done Supper, since the Ladies seem pleas’d with it. Why, Sir, said I, her Ladyship went on in the same manner; but said one time, (and held me by the Hand) she would give me a hundred Guineas for one provoking Word, or if I would but say, I <em class="calibre6">believ’d</em> myself marry’d, that she might fell me at her Foot. But, Sir, you must not be angry with her Ladyship. She call’d me <em class="calibre6">Painted Dirt, Baby-face, Waiting-maid, Beggar-brat</em>, and <em class="calibre6">Beggar-born</em>; but I said, as long as I knew my Innocence, I was easy in every thing, but to have my dear Parents abused. I said, they were never Beggars, nor beholden to any body; nor to any thing but God’s Grace, and their own Labour: That they once lived in Credit; that Misfortunes might befal any body; and that I could not bear they should be treated so undeservedly.</p>
<p class="indent">Then her Ladyship said, Ay, she supposed my Master’s Folly would make us now set up for a Family, and that the Herald’s Office would shortly be search’d to make it out.</p>
<p class="indent">Exactly my Sister again! said he. So you could not please her any way?</p>
<p class="indent">No, indeed, Sir. When she commanded me to fill her a Glass of Wine, and would not let her Woman do it, she ask’d, If I was above it? I then said, If, to attend your Ladyship at Table, or even kneel at your Feet, was requir’d of me, I would most gladly do it, were I only the Person you think me. But, if it be to triumph over one, who has received Honours that she thinks require from her another Part, that she may not be utterly unworthy of them, I must say, I cannot do it. This quite astonish’d her Ladyship; and a little before, her Kinsman brought me the Bottle and Glass, and requir’d me to fill it for my Lady at her Command, and call’d himself my Deputy; and I said, <a id="page_411"></a>’Tis in a good Hand; help my Lady yourself. So, Sir, added I, you see I could be a little saucy upon Occasion.</p>
<p class="indent">You please me well, my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said he. This was quite right. But proceed.</p>
<p class="indent">Her Ladyship said, She was astonish’d! adding, She suppos’d I would have her look upon me as her Brother’s Wife: And ask’d me, What, in the Name of Impudence, possessed me, to <em class="calibre6">dare</em> to look upon myself as her Sister! And I said, That was a Question better became her most worthy Brother to answer than me. And then I thought I should have had her Ladyship upon me; but her Woman interposed.</p>
<p class="indent">I afterwards told Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> at the Window, That since I was hinder’d from going to you, I believ’d it was best to let <em class="calibre6">Robert</em> go with the Chariot, and say, Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> was come, and I could not leave her Ladyship. But this did not please, and I thought it would, too; for she said, No, no, he’ll think I make the Creature my Companion, and know not how to part with her.</p>
<p class="indent">Exactly, said he, my Sister again!</p>
<p class="indent">And she said, I knew nothing what belong’d to People of Condition; how should I?—What <em class="calibre6">shall</em> I say, Madam? said I. Nothing at all, answer’d she; let him expect his <em class="calibre6">dearest Love</em>, alluding to your kind Epithet in your Letter, and be disappointed; it is but adding a few more Hours to this heavy Absence, and every one will become a Day in his amorous Account.</p>
<p class="indent">So, to be short, I saw nothing to be done, and I fear’d, Sir, you would wonder at my Stay, and be angry; and I watch’d my Opportunity, while my Lady, who was walking about the Room, was at the further End; and the Parlour being a Ground-floor in a manner, I jump’d out of the Window, and run for it.</p>
<p class="indent">Her Ladyship call’d after me; so did her Woman; and I heard her say, I flew like a Bird; and she call’d to two of her Servants in Sight to stop me; but I said, Touch me at your Peril, Fellows. And Mr. <em class="calibre6">Colbrand</em> having been planted at hand by Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, (who was very good in the whole Affair, and incurr’d her Ladyship’s Displeasure, once or twice, by taking my Part, seeing how I was us’d) put on a fierce Look, cock’d his Hat with one Hand, and put t’other on his Sword, and said, He would chine the Man who offer’d to touch his Lady. And so he ran a long-side of me, and could hardly keep Pace with me:—And here, my dear Sir, concluded I, I am, at yours, and the good Company’s Service.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_412"></a>They seem’d highly pleas’d with my Relation; and my Master said, he was glad Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> behav’d so well, as also Mr. <em class="calibre6">Colbrand</em>. Yes, Sir, said I, when Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> interposed once, her Ladyship said, It was hard, she, who was born in that House, could not have some Privilege in it, without being talk’d to by the saucy Servants. And she call’d her another time <em class="calibre6">Fat-face</em>, and <em class="calibre6">woman’d</em> her most violently.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, said my Master, I am glad, my Dear, you have had such an Escape. My Sister was always passionate, as Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em> knows. And my poor Mother had enough to do with us both. For we neither of us wanted Spirit; and when I was a Boy, I never came home from School or College, for a few Days, but tho’ we long’d to see one another before, yet ere the first Day was over, we had a Quarrel; for she being seven Years older than me, was always for domineering over me, and I could not bear it. And I used, on her frequently quarrelling with the Maids, and being always a Word and a Blow, to call her Captain <em class="calibre6">Bab</em>; for her Name is <em class="calibre6">Barbara</em>. And when my Lord <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> courted her, my poor Mother has made up Quarrels between them three times in a Day; and I used to tell her, she would certainly beat her Husband, marry whom she would, if he did not beat her first, and break her Spirit.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet has she, continued he, very good Qualities. She was a dutiful Daughter, is a good Wife; she is bountiful to her Servants, firm in her Friendships, charitable to the Poor, and, I believe, never any Sister better loved a Brother, than she me: And yet, she always lov’d to vex and teaze me; and as I would bear a Resentment longer than she, she’d be one Moment the most provoking Creature in the World, and the next would do any thing to be forgiven; and I have made her, when she was the Aggressor, follow me all over the House and Garden to be upon good Terms with me.</p>
<p class="indent">But this Case piques her the more, because she had found out a Match for me, in the Family of a Person of Quality, and had set her Heart upon bringing it to Effect, and had even proceeded far in it, without my Knowledge, and brought me into the Lady’s Company, unknowing of her Design: But I was then averse to Matrimony at all; and was angry at her proceeding in it so far without my Privity or Encouragement: And she cannot, for this Reason, bear the Thoughts of my being now marry’d; and to her Mother’s Waiting-maid too, as she reminds my dear <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, when I had declin’d her Proposal with the Daughter of a noble Earl.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_413"></a>This is the whole Case, said he; and allowing for the Pride and Violence of her Spirit, and that she knows not, as I do, the transcendent Excellencies of my dear Spouse, and that all her View, in her own Conception, is, mine and my Family’s Honour, she is a little to be allow’d for. Tho’ never fear, my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, but that I, who never had a Struggle with her, that I did not get the better, will do you Justice, and myself too.</p>
<p class="indent">This Account of Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> pleas’d every body, and was far from being to her Ladyship’s Disadvantage in the main: And I would do any thing in the World to have the Honour to be in her Ladyship’s good Graces. Yet I fear it will not be easily, if at all effected. But I will proceed:</p>
<p class="indent">After Supper, nothing would serve Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em> and Miss <em class="calibre6">Boroughs</em>, but we must have a Dance, and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em>, who plays a good Fiddle, urg’d it forward; my dear Master, tho’ in a Riding-dress, danc’d (and danc’d sweetly) with Miss <em class="calibre6">Boroughs</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Sir <em class="calibre6">Simon</em>, for a Gentleman of his Years, danc’d well, and took me out; but put on one of his free Jokes, that I was fitter to dance with a younger Gentleman; and he would have it, tho’ I had not danc’d since my dear Lady’s Death to signify, except once or twice to please Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>, and indeed believ’d all my dancing Days over, that as my Master and I were the best Dancers, we should dance once together <em class="calibre6">before</em> Folks, as the odd Gentleman said; and my dear Sir was pleas’d to oblige him: And he afterwards danc’d with Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em>, who I think has much more Skill and Judgment than I; tho’ they compliment me with an easier Shape and Air.</p>
<p class="indent">We left the Company, with great Difficulty, at about Eleven, my dear Master having been up all Night before, and we being at the greatest Distance from Home; tho’ they seem’d inclinable not to break up so soon, as they were Neighbours; and the Ladies said they long’d to hear what would be the End of Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>’s Interview with her Brother.</p>
<p class="indent">My Master said, He fear’d we must not now think of going next Day to <em class="calibre6">Bedfordshire</em>, as we had intended, and perhaps might see them again. And so we took Leave, and set out for Home; where we arriv’d not till Twelve o’ Clock; and found Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> had gone to Bed about Eleven, wanting sadly that we should come home first; but so did not I.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> told us, That my Lady was sadly fretted, that I had <a id="page_414"></a>got away so; and seem’d a little apprehensive of what I would say of the Usage I had receiv’d from her. She ask’d Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, If she thought I was really marry’d? And Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> telling her, Yes, she fell into a Passion, and said, Begone, bold Woman; I cannot bear thee. See not my Face till I send for thee. Thou hast been very impudent to me once or twice to-day already, and art now worse than ever. She said, She would not have told her Ladyship, if she had not ask’d her; and was sorry she had offended.</p>
<p class="indent">She sent for her at Supper-time; Said she, I have another Question to ask thee, Woman, and tell me Yes, if thou darest. Was ever any thing so odd?—Why then, said Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, I will say No, before your Ladyship speaks.—My Master laugh’d, Poor Woman! said he.—She call’d her <em class="calibre6">insolent</em>, and <em class="calibre6">Assurance</em>; and said, Begone, bold Woman as thou art;—but come hither. Dost thou know if that young Harlot is to lie with my Brother to-night?</p>
<p class="indent">She said, she knew not what to answer, because she had threaten’d her, if she said Yes. But at last, my Lady said, I will know the Bottom of this Iniquity. I suppose they won’t have so much Impudence to lie together, while I’m in the House; but I dare say they have been Bed-fellows.</p>
<p class="indent">Said she, I will lie to-night in the Room I was born in; so get that Bed ready. That Room being our Bed-chamber, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, after some Hesitation, reply’d, Madam, my Master lies there, and has the Key. I believe, Woman, said she, thou tellest me a Story. Indeed Madam, said she, he does; and has some Papers there he will let nobody see; for Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> said, she fear’d she would beat her, if she went up, and found by my Cloaths, and some of my Master’s, how it was.</p>
<p class="indent">So she said, I will then lie in the best Room, as it is called; and <em class="calibre6">Jackey</em> shall lie in the little green Room adjoining to it. Has thy Master got the Key of those?—No, Madam, said Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>; I will order them to be made ready for your Ladyship.</p>
<p class="indent">And where dost thou lay thy pursy Sides, said she? Up two Pair of Stairs, Madam, next the Garden. And where lies the young Harlotry, continued she? Sometimes with me, Madam, said she. And sometimes with thy virtuous Master, I suppose, said my Lady.—Ha, Woman! what say’st thou? I must not speak, said Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>. Well, thou mayst go, said she; but thou hast the Air of a Secret-keeper of that sort: I dare say thou’lt set the good Work <a id="page_415"></a>forward most cordially. Poor Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes!</em> said my Master, and laugh’d most heartily.</p>
<p class="indent">This Talk we had whilst we were undressing. So she and her Woman lay together in the Room my Master lay in before I was happy.</p>
<p class="indent">I said, Dear Sir, pray in the Morning let me lock myself up in the Closet, as soon as you rise; and not be call’d down for ever so much; for I am afraid to see her Ladyship: And I will employ myself about my Journal, while these Things are in my Head. Don’t be afraid, my Dear, said he; am not I with you?</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> pity’d me for what I had undergone in the Day; and I said, We won’t make the worst of it to my dear Master, because we won’t exasperate where we would reconcile; but, added I, I am much oblig’d to you, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, and I thank you. Said my Master, I hope she did not beat your Lady, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes?</em> Not much, Sir, said she; but I believe I sav’d my Lady once: Yet, added she, I was most vex’d at the young Lord. Ay, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, said my Master, let me know his Behaviour. I can chastise him, tho’ I cannot my Sister, who is a Woman; let me therefore know the Part he acted.</p>
<p class="indent">Nothing, my dear Sir, said I, but Impertinence, if I may so say, and Foolishness, that was very provoking; but I spared him not, and so there is no Room, Sir, for your Anger. No, Sir, said Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, nothing else indeed.</p>
<p class="indent">How was her Woman? said my Master. Pretty impertinent, reply’d Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, as Ladies Women will be. But, said I, you know she sav’d me once or twice. Very true, Madam, return’d Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>. And she said to me at Table, continued she, that you was a sweet Creature; she never saw your Equal; but that you had a Spirit, and she was sorry you answer’d her Lady so, who never bore so much Contradiction before. I told her, added Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, that if I was in your Ladyship’s Place, I should have taken much more upon me, and that you was all Sweetness. And she said, I was got over, she saw.</p>
