<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">TUESDAY Morning, the Sixth of my Happiness</em><a id="exp-note_98"></a><a href="part0021_split_098.html#exp-note-98" class="nounder">*</a></h4>
<p class="noindent">MY Master had said to Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, That he should not rise till Eight or Nine, as he had sat up all the Night before; but it seems, my Lady, knowing he usually rose about Six, got up soon after that Hour, rais’d her Woman, and her Nephew; having a whimsical <a id="page_416"></a>Scheme in her Head, to try to find whether we were in Bed together: And at about half an Hour after Six, she rapt at our Chamber-door.</p>
<p class="indent">My Master was wak’d at the Noise, and asked who was there? Open the Door, said she; open it this Minute! I said, clinging about his Neck, Dear, dear Sir, pray, pray don’t!—O save me, save me! Don’t fear, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said he. The Woman’s mad, I believe.</p>
<p class="indent">But he call’d out, Who are you? What do you want?—You know my Voice well enough, said she!—I <em class="calibre6">will</em> come in!—Pray, Sir, said I, don’t let her Ladyship in.—Don’t be frighted, my Dear, said he; she thinks we are not marry’d, and are afraid to be found a-bed together. I’ll let her in; but she shan’t come near my Dearest.</p>
<p class="indent">So he slipt out of Bed, and putting on some of his Cloaths, and Gown, and Slippers, he said, What bold body dares disturb my Repose thus? and open’d the Door. In rush’d she; I’ll see your Wickedness, said she, I will! In vain shall you think to hide it from me!—What should I hide? said he. How dare you set a Foot into my House after the Usage I have receiv’d from you?—I had cover’d myself over Head and Ears, and trembled every Joint. He look’d and ’spy’d her Woman, and Kinsman, in the Room, she crying out, Bear Witness, <em class="calibre6">Jackey</em>; bear Witness, <em class="calibre6">Beck</em>; the Creature is now in his Bed. And not seeing the young Gentleman before, who was at the Feet of the Bed, he said, How now, Sir? What’s your Business in this Apartment! Begone this Moment!—And he went away directly.</p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre6">Beck</em>, said my Lady, you see the Creature is in his Bed. I do, Madam, answer’d she. My Master came to me, and said, Ay look, <em class="calibre6">Beck</em>, and bear Witness; here is my <em class="calibre6">Pamela!</em>—My dear Angel, my lovely Creature, don’t be afraid; look up, and see how frantickly this Woman of Quality behaves.</p>
<p class="indent">At that I just peep’d, and saw my Lady, who could not bear this, coming to me; and she said, Wicked abandon’d Wretch, vile Brother, to brave me thus! I’ll tear the Creature out of Bed before your Face, and expose you both as you deserve.</p>
<p class="indent">At that he took her in his Arms, as if she had been nothing, and carrying her out of the Room, she cry’d out, <em class="calibre6">Beck, Beck!</em> help me, <em class="calibre6">Beck</em>; the Wretch is going to fling me down Stairs. Her Woman ran to him, and said, Good Sir, for God’s sake, do no Violence to my Lady: Her Ladyship has been ill all Night.</p>
<p class="indent">He sat her down in the Chamber she lay in, and she could not speak for Passion. Take care of your Lady, said he; and when she has <a id="page_417"></a>render’d herself more worthy of my Attention, I’ll see her; till then, at her Peril, and yours too, come not near my Apartment. And so he came to me, and with all the sweet soothing Words in the world, pacify’d my Fears, and gave me Leave to go to write in my Closet, as soon as my Fright was over, and to stay there till Things were more calm. And so he dress’d himself, and went out of the Chamber, permitting me, at my Desire, to fasten the Door after him.</p>
<p class="indent">At Breakfast-time my Master tapp’d at the Door, and I said, Who’s there? I, my Dearest, said he. Oh! then, reply’d I, will I open it with Pleasure. I had wrote on a good deal; but I put it by when I ran to the Door. I would have lock’d it again, when he was in; but he said, Am not I here! Don’t be afraid. Said he, Will you come down to Breakfast, my Love? O no, dear Sir, said I; be pleas’d to excuse me. Said he, I cannot bear the Look of it, that the Mistress of my House should breakfast in her Closet, as if she durst not come down, and I in it!—O dearest Sir, reply’d I, pray pass that over for my sake; and don’t let my Presence aggravate your Sister, for a kind Punctilio. Then, my Dear, said he, I shall breakfast with you here. No, pray, dear Sir, answer’d I, breakfast with your Sister. That, my Dear, reply’d he, will too much gratify her Pride, and look like a Slight to you.—Dear Sir, said I, your Goodness is too great, for me to want punctilious Proofs of it. Pray oblige her Ladyship. She is your Guest; surely, Sir, you may be freest with your dutiful Wife!</p>
<p class="indent">She is a strange Woman, said he: How I pity her!—She has thrown herself into a violent Fit of the Colick, thro’ Passion: And is but now, her Woman says, a little easier. I hope, Sir, said I, when you carry’d her Ladyship out, you did not hurt her. No, reply’d he, I love her too well. I sat her down in the Apartment she had chosen; and she but now desires to see me, and that I will breakfast with her, or refuses to touch any thing. But, if my Dearest please, I will insist it shall be with you at the same time.</p>
<p class="indent">O no, no, dear Sir, said I; I should never forgive myself, if I did. I would on my Knees beg her Ladyship’s Goodness to me, now I am in your Presence, tho’ I thought I ought to carry it a little stiff when you was absent, for the sake of the Honour you had done me. And, dear Sir, if my deepest Humility will please, permit me to shew it.</p>
<p class="indent">You shall do nothing, return’d he, unworthy of my Wife, to please the proud Woman!—But I will, however, permit you to breakfast by yourself this once, as I have not seen her since I have used her in so <a id="page_418"></a>barbarous a manner, as I understand she exclaims I have; and as she will not eat any thing, unless I give her my Company.—So he saluted me, and withdrew, and I lock’d the Door after him again for Fear.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, soon after, rapp’d at my Door. Who’s there? said I. Only I, Madam. So I open’d the Door. ’Tis a sad Thing, Madam, said she, you should be so much afraid in your own House. She brought me some Chocolate and Toast; and I ask’d her about my Lady’s Behaviour. She said, She would not suffer any body to attend but her Woman, because she would not be heard what she had to say; but she believ’d, she said, her Master was very angry with the young Lord, as she call’d her Kinsman; for as she pass’d by the Door, she heard him say, in a high Tone, I hope, Sir, you did not forget what belongs to the Character you assume: or to that Effect.—</p>
<p class="indent">About one o’Clock, my Master came up again, and he said, Will you come down to Dinner, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, when I send for you? Whatever you command, Sir, I must do: But my Lady won’t desire to see me. No matter whether she will or no. But I will not suffer that she shall prescribe her insolent Will to my Wife, and in your own House too.—I will by my Tenderness to you, mortify her Pride, and it cannot be done so well as to her Face.</p>
<p class="indent">Dearest Sir, said I, pray indulge me, and let me dine here by myself. It will make my Lady but more inveterate.—Said he, I have told her we are marry’d. She is out of all Patience about it, and yet pretends <em class="calibre6">not</em> to believe it. Upon that I tell her, Then she shall have it her own way, and that I am <em class="calibre6">not</em>. And what has she to do with it either way? She has scolded and begg’d, commanded and pray’d, bless’d me, and curs’d me, by Turns, twenty times, in these few Hours. And I have sometimes soothed her, sometimes storm’d at her, sometimes argued, sometimes raged; and at last I left her, and took a Turn in the Garden for an Hour to compose myself, because you should not see how the foolish Woman ruffled me; and just now, I came out, seeing her coming in.</p>
<p class="indent">Just as he had said so, I cry’d, Oh! my Lady, my Lady! for I heard her Voice in the Chamber, saying, Brother, Brother, one Word with you!—Stopping in Sight of the Closet where I was. He stept out, and she went up to the Window that looks towards the Garden, and said, Mean Fool that I am, to follow you up and down the House in this manner, tho’ I am shunn’d and avoided by you! You a Brother!—you a Barbarian!—Is it possible we could be born of one Mother?</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_419"></a>Why, said he, do you charge me with a Conduct to you, that you bring upon yourself?—Is it not surprizing, that you should take Liberties with me, that the dear Mother you have nam’d, never gave you an Example for to any of her Relations?—Was it not sufficient, that I was insolently taken to Task by you in your Letters, but my Retirements must be invaded? My House insulted? And, if I have one Person dearer to me than another, that that Person must be singled out for an Object of Violence?</p>
<p class="indent">Ay, said she, that one Person is the Thing!—But tho’ I came up with a Resolution to be temperate, and to expostulate with you on your avoiding me so unkindly, yet cannot I have Patience to look upon that Bed in which I was born, and to be made the guilty Scene of your Wickedness with such a——</p>
<p class="indent">Huh! said he, I charge you, call not the dear Girl by any Name unworthy of her. You know not, as I told you, her Excellence; and I desire you’ll not repeat the Freedoms you have taken below.</p>
<p class="indent">She stamp’d with her Foot, and said, God give me Patience! So much Contempt to a Sister that loves you so well; and so much Tenderness to a vile——</p>
<p class="indent">He put his Hand before her Mouth, Be silent, said he, once more, I charge you. You know not the Innocence you abuse so freely; I ought not, neither will I bear it.</p>
<p class="indent">She sat down, and fann’d herself, and burst into Tears, and such Sobs of Grief, or rather Passion, that griev’d me to hear; and I sat and trembled sadly.—</p>
<p class="indent">He walk’d about the Room, in great Anger; and at last said, Let me ask you, Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>, why I am thus insolently to be called to Account by you. Am I not independent? Am I not of Age? Am I not at Liberty to please myself?—Would to God, that instead of a Woman and my Sister, any Man breathing had dar’d, whatever his Relation under that of a Father, to give himself half the Airs you have done!—Why did you not send of this accursed Errand your Lord, who could write me such a Letter as no Gentleman should write, nor any Gentleman tamely receive? He should have seen the Difference.</p>
<p class="indent">We all know, said she, that since your <em class="calibre6">Italian</em> Duel, you have commenc’d a Bravo; and all your Airs breathe as strongly of the Manslayer as of the Libertine. This, said he, I will bear; for I have no Reason to be asham’d of that Duel, nor the Cause of it; since it was <a id="page_420"></a>to save a Friend; and because ’tis levell’d at myself only: But suffer not your Tongue to take too great a Liberty with my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">She interrupted him, in a violent Burst of Passion. If I bear this, said she, I can bear any thing!—O the little Strumpet!—He interrupted her then, and said wrathfully, Begone, rageful Woman, begone this Moment from my Presence! Leave my House this Instant!—I renounce you, and all Relation to you; and never more let me see your Face, or call me Brother. And took her by the Hand to lead her out. She laid hold of the Curtains of the Window, and said, I will not go! you shall not force me from you thus ignominiously in the Wretch’s Hearing, and suffer <em class="calibre6">her</em> to triumph over me in your barbarous Treatment of me.</p>
<p class="indent">Not considering any thing, I run out of the Closet, and threw myself at my dear Master’s Feet, as he held her Hand, in order to lead her out; and I said, Dearest Sir, let me beg, that no Act of Unkindness, for my sake, pass between so worthy and so near Relations. Dear, dear Madam, said I, and clasp’d her Knees, pardon and excuse the unhappy Cause of all this Evil; on my Knees I beg your Ladyship to receive me to your Grace and Favour, and you shall find me incapable of any Triumph but in your Ladyship’s Goodness to me.</p>
<p class="indent">Creature, said she, art <em class="calibre6">thou</em> to beg an Excuse for me!—Art <em class="calibre6">thou</em> to implore my Forgiveness! Is it to <em class="calibre6">thee</em> I am to owe the Favour that I am not cast headlong from my Brother’s Presence! Begone to thy Corner, Wench; begone, I say, lest thy Paramour kill me for trampling thee under my Foot.</p>
<p class="indent">Rise, my dear <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said my Master; rise, dear Life of my Life, and expose not so much Worthiness to the ingrateful Scorn of so violent a Spirit. And so he led me to my Closet again, and there I sat and wept.</p>
<p class="indent">Her Woman came up, just as he had led me to my Closet, and was returning to her Lady; and she very humbly said, Excuse my Intrusion, good Sir!—I hope I may come to my Lady. Yes, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Worden</em>, said he, you may come in, and pray take your Lady down Stairs with you, for fear I should too much forget what belongs either to my Sister or myself!</p>
<p class="indent">I began to think (seeing her Ladyship so outrageous with her Brother) what a happy Escape I had had the Day before, tho’ hardly enough us’d in Conscience too, as I thought.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_421"></a>Her Woman begg’d her Ladyship to walk down, and she said, <em class="calibre6">Beck</em>, seest thou that Bed? That was the Bed that I was born in; and yet that was the Bed, thou sawest as well as I, the wicked <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> in this Morning, and this Brother of mine just risen from her!</p>
<p class="indent">True, said he; you both saw it, and ’tis my Pride that you <em class="calibre6">could</em> see it. ’Tis my Bridal-bed, and ’tis abominable, that the Happiness I knew before you came hither, should be so barbarously interrupted.</p>
<p class="indent">Swear to me but, thou bold Wretch, said she; swear to me, that <em class="calibre6">Pamela Andrews</em> is really and truly thy lawful Wife, without Sham, without Deceit, without Double-meaning, and I know what I have to say.</p>
<p class="indent">I’ll humour you for once, said he; and then swore a solemn Oath, that I was. And, said he, did I not tell you so at first?</p>
<p class="indent">I cannot yet believe you, said she, because, in this Particular, I had rather have called you <em class="calibre6">Knave</em> than <em class="calibre6">Fool</em>.—Provoke me not too much, said he; for if I should as much forget myself as you have done, you’d have no more of a Brother in me, than I have a Sister in you!</p>
<p class="indent">Who marry’d you? said she; tell me that: Was it not a broken Attorney in a Parson’s Habit? Tell me truly, in the Wench’s Hearing. When she’s undeceived, she’ll know how to behave herself better! Thank God, thought I, it is not so.</p>
<p class="indent">No, said he, and I’ll tell you, that I bless God, I abhorred that Project, before it was brought to bear; and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em> marry’d us.—Nay then, said she—but answer me another Question or two, I beseech you. Who gave her away? Parson <em class="calibre6">Peters</em>, said he. Where was the Ceremony perform’d? In my own little Chapel, which you may see, as it was put in Order on purpose.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, said she, I begin to fear there is something in it! But who was present? said she. Methinks, reply’d he, I look like a fine Puppy, to suffer myself to be thus interrogated by an insolent Sister. But, if you must know, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> was present. O the Procuress, said she! But nobody else? Yes, said he, all my Heart and Soul!</p>
<p class="indent">Wretch! said she! And what would thy Father and Mother have said, had they lived to this Day? Their Consents, reply’d he, I should have thought it my Duty to ask; but not yours, Madam.</p>
<p class="indent">Suppose, said she, I had marry’d my Father’s Groom! what would you have said to that?—I could not have behav’d worse, reply’d he, than you have done. And would you not have thought, said she, I had deserv’d it?</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_422"></a>Said he, Does your Pride let you see no Difference in the Case you put? None at all, said she. Where can the Difference be between a Beggar’s Son marry’d by a Lady; or a Beggar’s Daughter made a Gentleman’s Wife?</p>
<p class="indent">Then I’ll tell you, reply’d he; The Difference is, a Man ennobles the Woman he takes, be she <em class="calibre6">who</em> she will; and adopts her into his own Rank, be it <em class="calibre6">what</em> it will: But a Woman, tho’ ever so nobly born, debases herself by a mean Marriage, and descends from her own Rank, to his she stoops to.</p>
<p class="indent">When the noble Family of <em class="calibre6">Stuart</em> ally’d itself into the low Family of <em class="calibre6">Hyde</em>, (comparatively low, I mean) did any body scruple to call the Lady Royal Highness, and Duchess of <em class="calibre6">York?</em><a id="exp-note_99"></a><a href="part0021_split_099.html#exp-note-99" class="nounder">*</a> And did any body think her Daughters, the late Queen <em class="calibre6">Mary</em> and Queen <em class="calibre6">Anne</em>, less Royal for that?</p>
<p class="indent">When the broken-fortun’d Peer goes into the City to marry a rich Tradesman’s Daughter, be he Duke or Earl, does not his Consort immediately become ennobled by his Choice? and who scruples to call her Lady Duchess, or Countess?</p>
<p class="indent">But when a Duchess, or Countess Dowager, descends to mingle with a Person of obscure Birth, does she not then degrade herself? and is she not effectually degraded? And will any Duchess or Countess rank with her?</p>
<p class="indent">Now, Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>, do you not see a Difference between my marrying my dear Mother’s beloved and deserving Waiting-maid, with a Million of Excellencies about her, and such Graces of Mind and Person, as would adorn any Distinction; and your marrying a sordid Groom, whose constant Train of Education, Conversation, and Opportunities, could possibly give him no other Merit, than that which must proceed from the vilest lowest Taste, in his sordid Dignifier?</p>
<p class="indent">O the Wretch! said she, how he finds Excuses to palliate his Meanness!</p>
<p class="indent">Again, said he, let me observe to you, Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>, when a Duke marries a private Person, is he not still her Head, by virtue of being her Husband? But, when a Lady descends to marry a Groom, is not that Groom her Head, as her Husband? And does not that Difference strike you? For what Lady of Quality ought to respect another, who has made so sordid a Choice, and set a Groom above her? For, would not that be to put that Groom upon a Par with <a id="page_423"></a>themselves?—Call this Palliation, or what you will; but if you see not the Difference, you are blind, and a very unfit Judge for yourself, much more unfit to be a Censurer of me.</p>
<p class="indent">I’d have you, said she, publish your fine Reasons to the World, and they will be sweet Encouragements to all the young Gentlemen that read them, to cast themselves away on the Servant-wenches in their Families.</p>
<p class="indent">Not at all, Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>, reply’d he: For, if any young Gentleman stays till he finds such a Person as my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>; so inrich’d with the Beauties of Person and Mind, so well accomplish’d, and so fitted to adorn the Degree she is raised to, he will stand as easily acquitted, as I shall be to all the World that sees her, except there be many more Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>’s than I apprehend can possibly be met with.</p>
<p class="indent">And so, return’d she, you say, You are actually and really marry’d, honestly, or rather foolishly, marry’d to this Slut?</p>
<p class="indent">I am indeed, said he, if you presume to call her so! And why should I not, if I please? Who is there ought to contradict me? Whom have I hurt by it?—Have I not an Estate, free and independent? Am I likely to be beholden to you, or any of my Relations? And why, when I have a Sufficiency in my own single Hands, should I scruple to make a Woman equally happy, who has all I want? For Beauty, Virtue, Prudence, and Generosity too, I will tell you, she has more than any Lady I ever saw. Yes, Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>, she has all these <em class="calibre6">naturally</em>; they are <em class="calibre6">born</em> with her; and a few Years Education, with her Genius, has done more for her, than a whole Life has done for others.</p>
<p class="indent">No more, no more, I beseech you, said she; thou surfeitest me, honest Man, with thy weak Folly. Thou art worse than an Idolater; thou hast made a graven Image, and thou fallest down and worship-pest the Works of thine own Hands; and, <em class="calibre6">Jeroboam</em> like, would have every body else bow down before thy Calf!<a id="exp-note_100"></a><a href="part0021_split_100.html#exp-note-100" class="nounder">*</a></p>
<p class="indent">Well said, Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers!</em> Whenever your Passion suffers you to descend to Witticism, ’tis almost over with you. But, let me tell you, tho’ I worship myself this sweet Creature that you call such Names, I want nobody else to do it; and should be glad you had not intruded upon me, to interrupt me in the Course of our mutual Happiness.</p>
<p class="indent">Well said, well said, my kind, my well-manner’d Brother! said she. I shall, after this, very little interrupt your mutual Happiness, I’ll assure you. I thought you a Gentleman once, and prided myself in <a id="page_424"></a>my Brother; but I’ll say with the Burial Service, <em class="calibre6">Ashes to Ashes, and Dirt to Dirt!</em></p>
<p class="indent">Ay, said he, Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>, and there we must all end at last; you with all your Pride, and I with my plentiful Fortune, must come to it; and then where will be your Distinction? Let me tell you, except you and I both mend our Manners, tho’ you have been no Duellist, no Libertine, as you call me, this amiable Girl, whom your Vanity and Folly so much despises, will out-soar us both, infinitely out-soar us; and He that judges best, will give the Preference where due, without Regard to Birth or Fortune.</p>
<p class="indent">Egregious Preacher, said she! What, my Brother already turn’d <em class="calibre6">Puritan!</em>—See what Marriage and Repentance may bring a Man to! I heartily congratulate this Change!—Well, said she, and came towards me, and I trembled to see her coming; but her Brother followed to observe her, and I stood up at her Approach, and she said, Give me thy Hand, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Andrews</em>, Mrs.——what shall I call thee!—Thou hast done Wonders in a little time: Thou hast not only made a Rake a Husband; but thou hast made a Rake a Preacher! But take care, added she, after all, in ironical Anger, and tapp’d me on the Neck, take care that thy Vanity begins not where his ends; and that thou callest not thyself my Sister!</p>
<p class="indent">She shall, I hope, Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>, said he, when she can make as great a Convert of you from Pride, as she has of me from Libertinism.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> just then came up, and said, Dinner was ready. Come, my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said my dear Master; you desired to be excus’d from breakfasting with us; but I hope you’ll give Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> and me your Company to Dinner.</p>
<p class="indent">How dare you insult me thus? said my Lady.—How dare you, said he, insult me by your Conduct in my own House, after I have told you I am marry’d? How dare you think of staying here one Moment, and refuse my Wife the Honours that belong to her, as such?</p>
<p class="indent">Merciful God! said she, give me Patience! and held her Hand to her Forehead.</p>
<p class="indent">Pray, Sir, dear Sir, said I, excuse me; don’t vex my Lady.—Be silent, my dear Love, said he; you see already what you have got by your sweet Condescension. You have thrown yourself at her Feet, and, insolent as she is, she has threaten’d to trample upon you. She’ll ask you presently, if she is to owe her Excuse to your Interposition; and yet nothing else can make her forgiven.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_425"></a>Poor Lady! she could not bear this, and, as if she was discomposed, she ran to her poor grieved Woman, and took hold of her Hand, and said, Lead me down, lead me down, <em class="calibre6">Beck!</em> Let us instantly quit this House, this cursed House, that once I took Pleasure in; order the Fellows to get ready, and I will never see it, nor its Owner, more. And away she went down Stairs, in a great Hurry. And the Servants were order’d to make ready for their Departure.</p>
<p class="indent">I saw my Master was troubled, and I went to him, and I said, Pray, dear Sir, follow my Lady down, and pacify her. ’Tis her Love to you.—Poor Woman! said he, I am concern’d for her! But I insist upon your coming down, since Things are gone so far. Her Pride will get new Strength else, and we shall be all to begin again.</p>
<p class="indent">Dearest, dear Sir, said I, excuse me going down this once! Indeed, my Dear, I won’t, reply’d he. What! shall it be said, that my Sister shall scare my Wife from my Table, and I present?—No, I have borne too much already; and so have you. And I charge you come down, when I send for you.</p>
<p class="indent">He departed, saying these Words, and I durst not dispute; for I saw, he was determin’d. And there is as much Majesty as Goodness in him; as I have often had Reason to observe, tho’ never more, than on the present Occasion with his Sister. Her Ladyship instantly put on her Hood and Gloves, and her Woman ty’d up a Handkerchief full of Things; for her principal Matters were not unpack’d, and her Coachman got her Chariot ready, and her Footmen their Horses, and she appear’d resolved to go. But her Kinsman and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Colbrand</em> had taken a Turn together, some-where; and she would not come in, but sat fretting on a Seat in the Fore-yard, with her Woman by her; and at last said, to one of the Footmen, Do you, <em class="calibre6">James</em>, stay, to attend my Nephew; and we’ll take the Road we came.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> went to her Ladyship, and said, Your Ladyship will be pleas’d to stay Dinner; ’tis just coming upon Table. No, said she, I have enough of this House! I have indeed. But give my Service to your Master, and I wish him happier than he has made me.</p>
<p class="indent">He had sent for me down, and I came, tho’ unwillingly, and the Cloth was laid in the Parlour I had jump’d out of; and there was my Master walking about it. Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> came in, and asked, If he pleas’d to have Dinner brought in? for my Lady would not come in, but desired her Service, and wish’d him happier than he had made her. He seeing at the Window, when he went to that Side of the <a id="page_426"></a>Room, all ready to go, stept out to her, and said, Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>, if I thought you would not be harden’d rather than soften’d by my Civility, I would ask you to walk in, and at least let your Kinsman and Servants dine before they go. She wept, and turn’d her Face from him to hide it; he took her Hand, and said, Come, Sister, let me prevail upon you: Walk in. No! said she, don’t ask me.—I wish I could hate you, as much as you hate me!—You do, said he, and a great deal more, I’ll assure you; or else you’d not vex me as you do.—Come, pray, walk in. Don’t ask me, said she. Her Kinsman just then return’d: Why, Madam, said he, your Ladyship won’t go till you have din’d, I hope. No, <em class="calibre6">Jackey</em>, said she, I can’t stay; I’m an <em class="calibre6">Intruder</em> here, it seems!—Think, said my Master, of the Occasion you gave for that Word. Your violent Passions are the only <em class="calibre6">Intruders!</em> Lay them aside, and never Sister was dearer to a Brother. Don’t say such another Word, said she, I beseech you; for I am too easy to forgive you any thing, for one kind Word!—You shall have One hundred, said he, nay, Ten thousand, if they will do, my dear Sister. And kissing her, he added, Pray give me your Hand. <em class="calibre6">John</em>, said he, put up the Horses; you are all as welcome to me, for all your Lady’s angry with me, as at any Inn you can put up at. Come, Mr. <em class="calibre6">H</em>. said he, lead your Aunt in; for she won’t permit that Honour to me.</p>
<p class="indent">This quite overcame her; and she said, giving her Brother her Hand, Yes, I will, and you shall lead me any-whither!—and kiss’d him. But don’t think, said she, I can forgive you neither. And so he led her into the Parlour where I was. But, said she, why do you lead me to this Wench? ’Tis my Wife, my dear Sister; and if you will not love her, yet don’t forget common Civilities to her, for your own sake.</p>
<p class="indent">Pray, Madam, said her Kinsman, since your Brother is pleas’d to own his Marriage, we must not forget common Civilities, as the ’Squire says. And, Sir, added he, permit me to wish you Joy. Thank you, Sir, said he. And may I, said he, looking at me? Yes, Sir, reply’d my Master. So he saluted me, very complaisantly, and said, I vow to Gad, Madam, I did not know this Yesterday; and, if I was guilty of a Fault, I beg your Pardon.</p>
<p class="indent">My Lady said, Thou’rt a good-natur’d foolish Fellow; thou mightst have sav’d this nonsensical Parade, till I had given thee Leave. Why, Aunt, said he, if they’re actually marry’d, there’s no Help for’t, and we must not make Mischief between Man and Wife.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_427"></a>But, Brother, said she, do you think I’ll sit at Table with the Creature? No contemptuous Names I beseech you, Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers!</em> I tell you she is really my Wife; and I must be a Villain to suffer her to be ill used. She has no Protector but me; and, if you will permit her, she will always love and honour you.—Indeed, indeed, I will, Madam, said I.</p>
<p class="indent">I cannot, I wo’not sit down at Table with her, said she: <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, I hope thou dost not think I will? Indeed, Madam, said I, if your good Brother will permit it, I will attend your Chair all the time you dine, to shew my Veneration for your Ladyship, as the Sister of my kind Protector. See, said he, her Condition has not altered her; but I cannot permit in her a Conduct unworthy of my Wife, and I hope my Sister would not expect it neither.</p>
<p class="indent">Let her leave the Room, reply’d she, if I must stay. Indeed, you’re out of the Way, Aunt, said her Kinsman; that is not right, as Things stand. Said my Master, No, Madam, that must not be; but if it must be so, we’ll have two Tables; you and your Nephew shall sit at one, and my Spouse and I at the other: And then see what a Figure your unreasonable Punctilio will make you cut.—She seem’d irresolute, and he sat her down at the Table, the first Course, which was Fish, being brought in. Where, said she to me, wouldst thou presume to sit? Wouldst have me give <em class="calibre6">Place</em> to thee <em class="calibre6">too</em>, Wench?—Come, come, said my Master, I’ll put that out of Dispute: and so sat himself down by her Ladyship, at the upper End of the Table, and plac’d me on his Left-hand. Excuse me, my Dear, said he, this once excuse me!—Oh! your cursed Complaisance, said she, to such a——Hush, Sister! Hush, said he! I will not bear her to be spoken slightingly of! ’Tis enough, that to oblige your violent and indecent Caprice, you make me compromise with you thus.</p>
<p class="indent">Come, Sir, added he, pray take your Place next your gentle Aunt!—<em class="calibre6">Beck</em>, said she, do you sit down by <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> there, since it must be so; we’ll be hail Fellow all! With all my Heart, reply’d my Master: I have so much Honour for all the Sex, that I would not have the meanest Person of it stand, while I sit, had I been to have made the Custom. Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Worden</em>, pray sit down. Sir, said she, I hope I shall know my Place better.</p>
<p class="indent">My Lady sat considering, and then lifting up her Hands, said, Lord! what will this World come to?—To nothing but what’s very good, reply’d my Master, if such Spirits as Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>’s do but take <a id="page_428"></a>the Rule of it. Shall I help you, Sister, to some of that Carp? Help your Beloved, said she! That’s kind, said he!—Now, that’s my good Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>. Here, my Love, let me help you, since my Sister desires it!—Mighty well! return’d she, mighty well!—But sat on one Side, turning from me, as it were.</p>
<p class="indent">Dear Aunt, said her Kinsman, let’s see you buss and be Friends; since ’tis so, what signifies it? Hold thy Fool’s Tongue, said she! Is thy Tone so soon turn’d since Yesterday? Said my Master, I hope nothing affronting was offer’d Yesterday to my Wife in her own House. She hit him a good smart Slap on the Shoulder; Take that, impudent Brother, said she. I’ll <em class="calibre6">Wife</em> you, and in <em class="calibre6">her own</em> House! She seem’d half afraid; but he, in very good Humour, kiss’d her, and said, I thank you, Sister, I thank you. But I have not had a Blow from you before of some Time!</p>
<p class="indent">’Fore Gad, Sir, said her Kinsman, ’tis very kind of you to take it so well. Her Ladyship is as good a Woman as ever liv’d; but I have had many a Cuff from her myself.</p>
<p class="indent">I won’t put it up neither, said my Master, except you’ll assure me, you have seen her serve her Lord so.</p>
<p class="indent">I press’d my Foot to his, and said, softly, Don’t, dear Sir!—What, said she, is the Creature begging me off from Insult? If <em class="calibre6">his</em> Manners won’t keep him from outraging me, I wo’not owe his Forbearance to <em class="calibre6">thee</em>, Wench.</p>
<p class="indent">Said my Master, and put some Fish on my Lady’s Plate, Well, does Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> use the Word <em class="calibre6">Insult!</em>—But, come, let me see you eat one Mouthful, and I’ll forgive you; and he put the Knife in one of her Hands, and the Fork in the other. As I hope to live, said he, I cannot bear this silly Childishness, for nothing at all. I am quite asham’d of it.</p>
<p class="indent">She put a little Bit to her Mouth, but put it down in her Plate again: I cannot eat, said she; I cannot swallow, I’m sure. It will certainly choak me. He had forbid his Men-servants to come in, that they might not behold the Scene he expected; and rose from Table himself, and fill’d a Glass of Wine, her Woman offering, and her Kinsman rising to do it. Mean-time, his Seat between us being vacant, she turn’d to me, How now, Confidence, said she, darest thou sit next <em class="calibre6">me?</em> Why dost thou not rise, and take the Glass from thy Property?</p>
<p class="indent">Sit still, my Dear, said he, I’ll help you both. But I arose; for I was <a id="page_429"></a>afraid of a good Cuff; and said, Pray, Sir, let me help my Lady! So you shall, reply’d he, when she’s in a Humour to receive it as she ought. Sister, said he, with a Glass in his Hand, Pray drink; you’ll perhaps eat a little Bit of something then. Is this to insult me, said she?—No, really, return’d he; but to incite you to eat; for you’ll be sick for want of it.</p>
<p class="indent">She took the Glass, and said, God forgive you, wicked Wretch, for your Usage of me this Day!—This is a little as it used to be!—I once had your Love;—and now it is changed; and for who? that vexes me! And wept so, she was forced to set down the Glass.</p>
<p class="indent">You don’t do well, said he. You neither treat me like your Brother, nor a Gentleman; and if you would suffer me, I would love you as well as ever.—But, for a Woman of Sense and Understanding, and a fine-bred Woman, as I once thought my Sister, you act quite a childish Part. Come, added he, and held the Glass to her Lips, let your Brother, that you once lov’d, prevail on you to drink this Glass of Wine.—She then drank it. He kiss’d her, and said, Oh! how Passion deforms the noblest Minds! You have lost a good deal of that Loveliness that used to adorn my Sister. And let me persuade you to compose yourself, and be my Sister again!—For Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> is indeed a fine Woman, and has a presence as majestick for a Lady, as her dear Brother has for a Gentleman.</p>
<p class="indent">He then sat down between us again, and said, when the second Course came in, Let <em class="calibre6">Abraham</em> come in, and wait. I touch’d his Toe again; but he minded it not; and I saw he was right; for her Ladyship began to recollect herself, and did not behave half so sorrowfully before the Servants, as she had done; and help’d herself with some little Freedom; but she could not forbear a strong Sigh and a Sob, now-and-then. She call’d for a Glass of the same Wine she had drank before. Said he, shall I help you again, Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers?</em>—and rose at the same time, and went to the Side-board, and filled her a Glass. Indeed, said she, I love to be sooth’d by my Brother!—Your Health, Sir!</p>
<p class="indent">Said my Master to me with great Sweetness, My Dear, now I’m up, I’ll fill for you!—I must serve <em class="calibre6">both</em> Sisters alike! She look’d at the Servant, as if he were a little Check upon her, and said to my Master, How now, Sir!—Not that you know of. He whisper’d her, Don’t shew any Contempt before my Servants to one I have so deservedly made their Mistress. Consider ’tis done.—Ay, said she, that’s the Thing that kills me.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_430"></a>He gave me a Glass; My good Lady’s Health, Sir, said I, and stood up.—That won’t do, said she, leaning towards me, softly; and was going to say, Wench, or Creature, or some such Word. And my Master, seeing <em class="calibre6">Abraham</em> look towards her, her Eyes being red and swell’d, said, Indeed, Sister, I would not vex myself about it, if I was you. About what, said she? Why, reply’d he, about your Lord’s not coming down, as he had promised. He sat down, and she tapp’d him on the Shoulder: Ah! Wicked-one, said she, nor will that do neither!—Why, to be sure, added he, it would vex a Lady of your Sense and Merit, to be slighted, if it was so; but I am sure my Lord loves you, as well as you love him; and you know not what may have happen’d.</p>
<p class="indent">She shook her Head, and said, That’s like your Art!—This makes one amaz’d you should be so caught!—Who, my Lord caught! said he; no, no! he’ll have more Wit than so! But I never heard you was jealous before. Nor, said she, have you any Reason to think so now! Honest Friend, you need not wait, said she, my Woman will help us to what we want. Yes, let him, reply’d he. <em class="calibre6">Abraham</em>, fill me a Glass. Come, said my Master, Lord <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> to you, Madam: I hope he’ll take care he is not found out!—You’re very provoking, Brother, said she. I wish you was as good as Lord <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>.—But don’t carry your Jest too far. Well, said he, ’tis a tender Point, I own. I’ve done!</p>
<p class="indent">By these kind Managements the Dinner passed over better than I expected. And when the Servants were withdrawn, my Master said, still keeping his Place between us, I have a Question to ask you, Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>; and that is, If you’ll bear me Company to <em class="calibre6">Bedfordshire</em>. I was intending to set out thither to-morrow. But I’ll tarry your Pleasure, if you’ll go with me.</p>
<p class="indent">Is thy Wife, as thou callest her, to go along with thee, Friend? said she. Yes, to be sure, answered he, my dear Quaker Sister,<a id="exp-note_101"></a><a href="part0021_split_101.html#exp-note-101" class="nounder">*</a> and took her Hand, and smil’d. And wouldst have me parade it with her on the Road?—Hay!—And make one to grace her Retinue?—Hay!—Tell me how thou’dst chalk it out, if I would do as thou wouldst have me, honest Friend!</p>
<p class="indent">He clasped his Arms about her, and kissed her: You are a dear saucy Sister, said he; but I must love you!—Why, I’ll tell you how I’d have it. Here shall you, and my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>—Leave out <em class="calibre6">my</em>, I desire you, if you’d have me sit patiently. No, said he, I can’t do that. Here shall you, and my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, go together in your Chariot, if you please; and <a id="page_431"></a>she will then appear as one of your Retinue; and your Nephew and I will sometimes ride, and sometimes go into my Chariot, to your Woman.</p>
<p class="indent">Shouldst thou like this, Creature? said she to me.—If your Ladyship think it not too great an Honour for me, Madam, said I. Yes, reply’d she, but my Ladyship does think it would be too great an Honour.</p>
<p class="indent">Now I think of it, said he, this must not be, neither; for without you’d give her the Hand, in your own Chariot, my Wife would be thought your Woman, and that must not be. Why, that would, maybe, said she, be the only Inducement for me to bear her near me, in my Chariot.—But, how then?—Why then, when we came home, we’d get Lord <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> to come to us, and stay a Month or two.</p>
<p class="indent">And what if he was to come?—Why I would have you, as I know you have a good Fancy, give <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> your Judgment on some Patterns I expect from <em class="calibre6">London</em>, for Cloaths.—Provoking Wretch! said she; now I wish I may keep my Hands to myself. I don’t say it to provoke you, said he, nor ought it to do so. But when I tell you, I am marry’d, Is it not a Consequence, that we must have new Cloaths?</p>
<p class="indent">Hast thou any more of these obliging things to say to me, Friend? said she. I will make you a Present, return’d he, worth your Acceptance, if you will grace us with your Company at Church, when we make our Appearance!—Take that, said she, if I die for’t; Wretch that thou art! And was going to hit him a great Slap, but he held her Hand. Her Kinsman said, Dear Aunt, I wonder at you! why all these are things of Course.</p>
<p class="indent">I begg’d Leave to withdraw; and, as I went out, my good Master said, There’s a Person! There’s a Shape! There’s a Sweetness! O Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers!</em> were you a Man, you would doat on her, as I do. Yes, said the naughty Lady, so I should, for my Harlot, but not for a Wife. I turn’d, on this, and said, Indeed your Ladyship is cruel; and well may Gentlemen take Liberties, when Ladies of Honour say such things! And I wept, and added, Your Ladyship’s Influence, if your good Brother were not the most generous of Men, would make me very unhappy.</p>
<p class="indent">No Fear, Wench; no Fear, said she: Thou’lt hold him, as long as any body can, I see that!—Poor <em class="calibre6">Sally Godfrey</em> never had half the Interest in him, I’ll assure you!</p>
<p class="indent">Stay, my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said he, in a Passion; stay, when I bid you. You <a id="page_432"></a>have heard, this Day, two vile Charges upon me! I love you with such a true Affection, that I ought to say something before this malicious Accuser, that you may not think your consummate Virtue link’d to too black a Villain.</p>
<p class="indent">Her Nephew seemed uneasy, and blam’d her much; and I came back, but trembled as I stood; and he sat me down, and said, taking my Hand, I have been accused, my Dear, as a Dueller, and now as a Profligate, in another Sense! and there was a Time, I should not have received these Imputations with so much Concern as I now do, when I would wish, by degrees, by a Conformity of my Manners to your Virtue, to shew every one the Force your Example has upon me. But this briefly is the Case of the first.</p>
<p class="indent">I had a Friend, who had been basely attempted to be assassinated by Bravoes, hir’d by a Man of Title in <em class="calibre6">Italy</em>, who, like many other Persons of Title, had no Honour; and at <em class="calibre6">Padua</em>, I had the Fortune to disarm one of these Bravoes in my Friend’s Defence, and made him confess his Employer; and him, I own, I challeng’d. At <em class="calibre6">Sienna</em> we met, and he dy’d in a Month after, of a Fever, but, I hope, not occasioned by the slight Wounds he had receiv’d from me, tho’ I was obliged to leave <em class="calibre6">Italy</em> upon it, sooner than I intended, because of his numerous Relations, who looked upon me as the Cause of his Death. Tho’ I pacify’d them by a Letter I wrote them from <em class="calibre6">Inspruck</em>, acquainting them with the Baseness of the Deceased; and they followed me not to <em class="calibre6">Munich</em>, as they had intended.</p>
<p class="indent">This is one of the good-natur’d Hints, that might shock your Sweetness on reflecting that you are yoked with a Murderer. The other—Nay, Brother, said she, say no more. ’Tis your own Fault if you go further. She shall know it all, said he; and I defy the utmost Stretch of your Malice.</p>
<p class="indent">When I was at College, I was well received by a Widow Lady, who ha i several Daughters, and but small Fortunes to give them; and the old Lady set one of them; a deserving good Girl she was; to draw me in to a Marriage with her, for the sake of the Fortune I was Heir to; and contriv’d many Opportunities to bring us and leave us together. I was not then of Age; and the young Lady, not half so artful as her Mother, yielded to my Addresses, before the Mother’s Plot could be ripen’d, and so utterly disappointed it. This, my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, is the <em class="calibre6">Sally Godfrey</em> this malicious Woman, with the worst Intentions, has inform’d you of. And whatever other Liberties I may have taken; for <a id="page_433"></a>perhaps some more I have, which, had she known, you had heard of, as well as this; I desire Heaven will only forgive me till I revive its Vengeance by the like Offences, in Injury to my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">And now, my Dear, you may withdraw; for this worthy Sister of mine has said all the Bad she knows of me; and what, at a proper Opportunity, when I could have convinced you, that they were not my <em class="calibre6">Boast</em>, but my <em class="calibre6">Concern</em>, I should have acquainted you with, myself; for I am not fond of being thought better than I am: Tho’, I hope, from the Hour I devoted myself to so much Virtue, to that of my Death, my Conduct shall be irreproachable.</p>
<p class="indent">She was greatly mov’d at this, and the noble Manner in which the dear Gentleman own’d and repented of his Faults; and gushed out into Tears, and said, No, don’t yet go, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, I beseech you. My Passion has carry’d me too far a great deal; and coming to me, she took my Hand, and said, You must stay to hear me beg his Pardon, and so took his Hand—But, to my Concern, (for I was grieved for her Ladyship’s Grief) he burst from her; and went out of the Parlour into the Garden, in a violent Rage, that made me tremble. Her Ladyship sat down, and leaned her Head against my Bosom, and made my Neck wet with her Tears, holding me by my Hands; and I wept for Company.—Her Kinsman walked up and down the Parlour, in a sad Fret; and going out afterwards, he came in, and said, The ’Squire has order’d his Chariot to be got ready, and won’t be spoken to by any body. Where is he? said she—Walking in the Garden till ’tis ready, reply’d he.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, said she, I have indeed gone too far. I was bewitched! And now, said she, malicious as he calls me, will he not forgive me for a Twelvemonth: For I tell you, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, if ever you offend, he will not easily forgive. I was all delighted, tho’ sad, to see her Ladyship so good to me. Will you venture, said she, to accompany me to him!—Dare you follow a Lion in his Retreats?—I’ll attend your Ladyship, said I, where-ever you command. Well, Wench, said she, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, I mean, thou art very good in the main!—I should have lov’d thee as well as my Mother did—if—but ’tis all over now! Indeed you should not have marry’d my Brother! But come, I must love him! Let’s find him out. And yet will he now use me worse than a Dog!—I should not, added she, have so much exasperated him: For whenever I have, I have always had the worst of it. He knows I love him!</p>
<p class="indent">In this manner her Ladyship talk’d to me, leaning on my Arm, <a id="page_434"></a>and walked into the Garden. I saw he was still in a Tumult, as it were; and he took another Walk to avoid us.—She call’d after him, and said, Brother, Brother, Let me speak to you!—One Word with you! And as we made haste towards him, and came near to him; I desire, said he, That you’ll not oppress me more with your Follies and your Violence. I have borne too much with you. And I will vow for a Twelvemonth, from this Day—Hush, said she, don’t vow, I beg you; for too well will you keep it, I know by Experience, if you do: You see, said she, I stoop to ask <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> to be my Advocate. Sure that will pacify you!</p>
<p class="indent">Indeed, said he, I desire to see neither of you, on such an Occasion; and let me only be left to myself; for I will not be intruded upon thus; and was going away.—But she said, One Word first, I desire—If you’ll forgive me, I’ll forgive you!—What, said the dear Man, haughtily, will you forgive me!—Why, said she, for she saw him too angry to mention his Marriage, as a Subject that requir’d her Pardon,—I will forgive you all your bad Usage of me this Day.</p>
<p class="indent">I will be serious with you, Sister, said he: I wish you most sincerely well; but let us, from this Time, study so much one another’s Quiet, as never to come near one another more.—Never? said she.—And can you desire this, barbarous Brother! can you?—I can. I do, said he; and I have nothing to do, but hide from you, not a Brother, but a Murderer, and a Profligate, unworthy of your Relation; and let me be consign’d to Penitence for my past Evils: A Penitence however, that shall not be broken in upon by so violent an Accuser.</p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said he, and made me tremble, How dare you approach me, without Leave, when you see me thus disturb’d!—Never, for the future, come near me, while I am in these Tumults, unless I send for you.</p>
<p class="indent">Dear Sir! said I—Leave me, interrupted he. I will set out for <em class="calibre6">Bedfordshire</em> this Moment: What! Sir, said I, without me?—What have I done! You have too meanly, said he, for my Wife, stooped to this furious Sister of mine; and, till I can recollect, I am not pleased with you: But <em class="calibre6">Colbrand</em> shall attend you, and two other of my Servants; and Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> shall wait upon you part of the Way. And I hope, you’ll find me in a better Disposition to receive you there, than I am at parting with you here.</p>
<p class="indent">Had I not hoped, that this was partly put on to intimidate my <a id="page_435"></a>Lady, I believe I could not have borne it: But it was grievous to me; for I saw he was most sincerely in a Passion.</p>
<p class="indent">I was afraid, said she, he would be angry at you, as well as me; for well do I know his unreasonable Violence, when he is moved. But one Word, Sir, said she; Pardon <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, if you won’t me; for she has committed no Offence, but that of Good-nature to me, and at my Request. I will begone myself, directly, as I was about to do, had you not prevented me.</p>
<p class="indent">I prevented you, said he, thro’ Love; but you have stung me for it, thro’ Hatred. But as for my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, I know, besides the present Moment, I cannot be angry with her; and therefore I desire her never to see me on such Occasions, till I can see her in the Temper I ought to be in when so much Sweetness approaches me. ’Tis therefore, I say, my Dearest, leave me now.</p>
<p class="indent">But, Sir, said I, must I leave you, and let you go to <em class="calibre6">Bedford</em> without me! O dear Sir, how can I?—Said my Lady, You may go to-morrow, both of you, as you had design’d, and I will go away this Afternoon; and since I cannot be forgiven, I will try to forget I have a Brother.</p>
<p class="indent">May I, Sir, said I, beg all your Anger on myself, and to be reconciled to your good Sister? Presuming <em class="calibre6">Pamela!</em> reply’d he, and made me start, art thou then so hardy, so well able to sustain a Displeasure, which, of all things, I expected, from thy Affection and thy Tenderness, thou wouldst have wished to avoid?—Now, said he, and took my Hand, and, as it were, tost it from him, begone from my Presence, and reflect upon what you have said to me!</p>
<p class="indent">I was so frighted, for then I saw he took amiss what I said, that I took hold of his Knees, as he was turning from me, and I said, Forgive me, good Sir; you see I am not so hardy! I cannot bear your Displeasure! And was ready to sink.</p>
<p class="indent">His Sister said, Only forgive <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>; ’tis all I ask!—You’ll break her Spirit quite!—You’ll carry your Passion as much too far as I have done!—I need not say, said he, how well I love her: but she must not intrude upon me at such times as these!—I had intended, as soon as I could have quell’d, by my Reason, the Tumults you had caused by your Violence, to have come in, and taken such a Leave of you both, as might become a Husband and a Brother; but she has, unbidden, broken in upon me, and must take the Consequence of a Passion, which, when raised, is as uncontroulable as your own.</p>
<p class="indent">Said she, Did I not love you so well, as Sister never loved a <a id="page_436"></a>Brother, I should not have given you all this Trouble. And did I not, said he, love you better than you are resolv’d to deserve, I should be indifferent to all you say. But this last Instance, (after the Duelling-story, which you would not have mention’d, had you not known it is always matter of Concern for me to think upon) of poor <em class="calibre6">Sally Godfrey</em>, is a Piece of Spite and Meanness, that I can renounce you my Blood for.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, said she, I am convinced it was wrong. I am asham’d of it myself. ’Twas poor, ’twas mean, ’twas unworthy of your Sister: And ’tis for this Reason I stoop to follow you, to beg your Pardon, and even to procure for my Advocate one, that I thought had some Interest in you, if I might have believed your own Professions to her; which now I shall begin to think made purposely to insult me.</p>
<p class="indent">I care not what you think!—After the Meanness you have been guilty of, I can only look upon you with Pity. For, indeed, you have fallen very low with me.</p>
<p class="indent">’Tis plain I have, said she. But, I’ll begone.—And so, Brother, let me call you so this once! God bless you! And, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said her Ladyship, God bless you! And kissed me, and wept.</p>
<p class="indent">I durst say no more; and my Lady turning from him, he said, Your Sex is the D—1; how strangely can you discompose, calm, and turn, as you please, us poor Weathercocks of Men! Your last kind Blessing to my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, I cannot stand! Kiss but each other again. And he then took both our Hands, and join’d them; and my Lady saluting me again, with Tears on both sides, he put his kind Arms about each of our Waists, and saluted us with great Affection, saying, Now, God bless you both, the two dearest Creatures I have in the World.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, said she, you will quite forget my Fault about Miss——He stopt her, before she could speak the Name, and said, For ever forget it!—And, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, I’ll forgive you too, if you don’t again make my Displeasure so light a thing to you, as you did just now!</p>
<p class="indent">Said my Lady, She did not make your Displeasure a light thing to her; but the heavier it was, the higher Compliment she made me, that she would bear it all, rather than not see you and me reconciled. No matter for that, said he: It was either an Absence of Thought, or a Slight, by Implication at least, that my Niceness could not bear from her Tenderness. For, looked it not presuming, that she could stand my Displeasure, or was sure of making her Terms when she pleas’d? <a id="page_437"></a>Which, fond as I am of her, I assure her, will not be always, in wilful Faults, in her own Power.</p>
<p class="indent">Nay, said my Lady, I can tell you, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, you have a Gentleman here in my Brother; and you may expect such Treatment from him, as that Character, and his known good Sense and Breeding, will always oblige him to shew: But <em class="calibre6">if</em> you offend, the Lord have Mercy upon you!—You see how it is by poor me!—And yet, I never knew him forgive so soon.</p>
<p class="indent">I am sure, said I, I will take care as much as I can! for I have been frighted out of my Wits, and had offended before I knew where I was.</p>
<p class="indent">So happily did this Storm blow over; and my Lady was quite subdu’d and pacify’d. When we came out of the Garden, his Chariot was ready; and he said, Well, Sister, I had most assuredly gone away towards my other House, if things had not taken this happy Turn; and if you please, instead of it, you and I will take an Airing: And pray, my Dear, said he to me, bid Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> order Supper by Eight o’Clock, and we shall then join you.</p>
<p class="indent">Sir, added he, to her Nephew, will you take your Horse, and escorte us. I will, said he; and am glad, at my Soul, to see you all so good Friends.—So my dear lordly Master (O my dear Parents! he is very dreadful when he pleases, I see!—But, I hope, I shall never incur his Anger) handed my Lady into his Chariot, and her Kinsman, and his Servant, rode after them; and I went up to my Closet, to ruminate on these things. And, foolish thing that I am, this poor Miss <em class="calibre6">Sally Godfrey</em> runs in my Head!—How soon the Name and Quality of a Wife gives one Privileges, in one’s own Account!—Yet, methinks, I want to know more about her; for, is it not strange, that I, who lived Years in the Family, should have heard nothing of this? But I was so constantly with my Lady, that I might the less hear of it; for she, I dare say, never knew it, or she would have told me.</p>
<p class="indent">But I dare not ask him about the poor Lady—Yet I wonder what became of her? Whether she be living? And whether any thing came of it?—May-be I shall hear full soon enough:—But I hope not to any bad Purpose.</p>
<p class="indent">As to the other unhappy Case, I know it was talk’d of, that in his Travels, before I was taken into the Family long, he had one or two Broils; and, from a Youth, he was always remarkable for Courage, and is reckon’d a great Master of his Sword. God grant he may never <a id="page_438"></a>be put to use it! And that he may be always preserved in Honour and Safety!<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">About Seven o’Clock, my Master sent word, that he would have me not expect him to Supper. For that he and my Lady his Sister, and Nephew, were prevailed upon to stay with Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em>; and that Lady <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em>, and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em>’s Family, had promised to meet them there. I was glad that they did not send for me; and the rather, as I hoped those good Families, being my Friends, would confirm my Lady a little in my Favour; and so I follow’d my Writing closely.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">About Eleven o’Clock they return’d. I had but just come down, having tir’d myself with my Pen, and was sitting talking with Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> and Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Worden</em>, whom I would, tho’ unwillingly on their Sides, make sit down over-against me. Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Worden</em> asked me Pardon, in a good deal of Confusion, for the Part she had acted against me; saying, That Things had been very differently represented to her; and that she little thought I had been marry’d, and that she was behaving so rudely to the Lady of the House.</p>
<p class="indent">I said, I took nothing amiss, and very freely forgave her; and hoped my new Condition would not make me forget how to behave properly to every one; but that I must endeavour to act not unworthy of it, for the Honour of the Gentleman who had so generously raised me to it.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> said, that my Situation gave me great Opportunities of shewing the Excellency of my Nature, that I could forgive Offences against me so readily, as she for her own Part, must always, she said, acknowledge, with Confusion of Face.</p>
<p class="indent">People, said I, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, don’t know how they shall act, when their Wills are in the Power of their Superiors; and I always thought one should distinguish between Acts of Malice, and of implicit Obedience; tho’, at the same time, a Person should know how to judge between Lawful and Unlawful. And even the Great, continued I, tho’ at present angry they are not obey’d, will afterwards have no ill Opinion of a Person for withstanding them in their unlawful Commands.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> seem’d a little concern’d at this; and I said, I spoke chiefly from my own Experience; for that I might say, as they both knew my Story, that I had not wanted both for Menaces and <a id="page_439"></a>Temptations; and had I comply’d with the one, or been intimidated by the other, I should not have been what I was.</p>
<p class="indent">Ah! Madam, said Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, I never knew any body like you: And I think your Temper sweeter since the happy Day, than before; and that, if possible, you take less upon you than before.</p>
<p class="indent">Why, a good Reason, said I, may be assigned for that: I thought myself in Danger: I look’d upon every one as my Enemy; and it was impossible that I should not be fretful, uneasy, jealous. But when my dearest Sir had taken from me the Ground of my Uneasiness, and made me quite happy, I should have been very blameable if I had not shewn a satisfy’d and easy Mind, and a Temper that should engage every one’s Respect and Love at the same time, if possible: And so much the more, as it was but justifying, in some sort, the Honour I had received; for the fewer Enemies I made myself, the more I engaged every one to think, that my good Benefactor had been less to blame in descending as he has done.</p>
<p class="indent">This way of talking pleas’d them both very much; and they made me many Compliments upon it, and wished me to be always happy, as, they said, I so well deserved.</p>
<p class="indent">We were thus engaged, when my Master and his Sister, and her Nephew, came in. And they made me quite alive, in the happy Humour in which they all return’d. The two Women would have withdrawn; but my Master said, Don’t go, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Worden</em>; Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, pray stay; I shall speak to you presently. So he came to me, and saluting me, said, Well, my dear Love, I hope I have not trespass’d upon your Patience, by an Absence longer than we design’d. But it has not been to your Disadvantage; for tho’ we had not your Company, we have talked of nobody else but you.</p>
<p class="indent">My Lady came up to me, and said, Ay, Child, you have been all our Subject. I don’t know how it is; but you have made two or three whole Families, in this Neighbourhood, as much your Admirers, as your Friend here.</p>
<p class="indent">My Sister, said he, has been hearing your Praises, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, from half a score Mouths, with more Pleasure than her Heart will easily let her express.</p>
<p class="indent">My good Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>’s Favour, said I, and the Continuance of yours, Sir, would give me more Pride than that of all the rest of the World put together.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, Child, said she, proud Hearts don’t come down all at once; <a id="page_440"></a>tho’ my Brother here has, this Day, set mine a good many Pegs lower than I ever knew it: But I will say, I wish you Joy with my Brother; and so kissed me.</p>
<p class="indent">My dear Lady, said I, you for ever oblige me!—I shall now believe myself quite happy. This was all I wanted to make me so!—And, I hope, I shall always, thro’ my Life, shew your Ladyship, that I have the most grateful and respectful Sense of your Goodness.</p>
<p class="indent">But, Child, said she, I shall not give you my Company when you make your Appearance. Let your own Merit make all your <em class="calibre6">Bedfordshire</em> Neighbours your Friends, as it has done here, by your <em class="calibre6">Lincolnshire</em> ones; and you’ll have no need of my Countenance, nor any body’s else.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, said her Nephew, ’tis my Turn; I wish you Joy with all my Soul, Madam; and, by what I have seen, and by what I have heard, ’fore Gad, I think you have met with no more than you deserve; and so all the Company says, where we have been. And pray forgive all my Nonsense to you.</p>
<p class="indent">Sir, said I, I shall always, I hope, respect as I ought, so near a Relation of my good Lord and Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>; and I thank you for your kind Compliment.</p>
<p class="indent">Gad, <em class="calibre6">Beck</em>, said he, I believe you’ve some Forgiveness too to ask; for we were all to blame, to make Madam, here, fly the Pit, as she did! Little did we think we made her quit her own House.</p>
<p class="indent">Thou always, said my Lady, say’st too much or too little.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Worden</em> said, I have been treated with so much Goodness and Condescension, since you went, that I have been beforehand, Sir, in asking Pardon for myself.</p>
<p class="indent">So my Lady sat down with me half an Hour, and told me how her Brother had carry’d her a fine Airing, and had quite charm’d her with his kind Treatment of her; and had much confirm’d her in the good Opinion she had begun to entertain of my discreet and obliging Behaviour: But, continued she, when he would make me visit, without intending to stay, my old Neighbours, (for, said she, Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em> being nearest, we visited her first; and she scrap’d all the rest of the Company together) they were all so full of your Praises, that I was quite borne down; and, truly, it was <em class="calibre6">Saul</em> among the Prophets!<a id="exp-note_102"></a><a href="part0021_split_102.html#exp-note-102" class="nounder">*</a></p>
<p class="indent">You may believe how much I was delighted with this; and I spar’d not my due Acknowledgments.</p>
<p class="indent">When her Ladyship took Leave, to go to-bed, she said, Good-night <a id="page_441"></a>to you, heartily, and to your good Man. I kiss’d you when I came in, out of Form; but I now kiss you out of more than Form, I’ll assure you.</p>
<p class="indent">Join with me, my dear Parents, in my Joy for this happy Turn; the contrary of which, I so much dreaded, and was the only Difficulty I had to labour with!—This poor Miss <em class="calibre6">Sally Godfrey</em>, I wonder what’s become of her, poor Soul!—I wish he would, of his own Head, mention her again.—Not that I am <em class="calibre6">very</em> uneasy neither.—You’ll say, I must be a little saucy, if I was.</p>
<p class="indent">My dear Master gave me an Account, when we went up, of the Pains he had taken with his beloved Sister, as he himself styled her; and of all the kind Things the good Families had said in my Behalf; and that he observ’d she was not so much displeas’d with hearing them, as she was at first; when she would not permit any body to speak of me as his Wife. And that my Health, as his Spouse, being put; when it came to her, she drank it; but said, Come, Brother, here’s your <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> to you.—But I shall not know how to stand this Affair, when the Countess——and the young Ladies come to visit me. It was with one of those young Ladies, that she was so fond of promoting a Match with her Brother.—Lady <em class="calibre6">Betty</em>, I know, said she, will rally me smartly upon it; and you know, Brother, she wants neither Wit, nor Satire. He said, I hope, Lady <em class="calibre6">Betty</em>, whenever she marries, will meet with a better Husband than I should have made her; for, on my Conscience, I think, I should hardly have made a tolerable one to any but <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">He told me, That they rallied him on the Stateliness of his Temper; and said, They saw he would make an exceeding good Husband where he was; but it must be owing to my Meekness, more than his Complaisance; for, said Miss <em class="calibre6">Darnford</em>, I could see, well enough, when your Ladyship detained her, tho’ he had but hinted his Desire of finding her at our House, he was so out of Humour at her supposed Non-complaisance, that mine and my Sister’s Pity for her was much more engag’d than our Envy.</p>
<p class="indent">Ay, said my Lady, he is too lordly a Creature, by much, and can’t bear Disappointment, and never could.</p>
<p class="indent">Said he, Well, Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>, you should not, of all Persons, find Fault with me; for I bore a great deal from you, before I was at all angry.</p>
<p class="indent">Yes, reply’d she; but when I had gone a little too far, as I own I did, <a id="page_442"></a>you made me pay for it severely enough! You know you did, Saucebox. And the poor thing too, added she, that I took with me for my Advocate, so low had he brought me! he treated in such a manner, as made my Heart ach for her: But part was <em class="calibre6">Art</em>, I know, to make me think the better of her.</p>
<p class="indent">Indeed, Sister, said he, there was very little of that; for, at that time, I cared not what you thought, nor had Complaisance enough to have given a Shilling for your good or bad Opinion of her or me. And, I own, I was displeased to be broken in upon, after your Provocations, by either of you; and she must learn that Lesson, never to come near me, when I am in those Humours; which shall be as little as possible; for, after a-while, if let alone, I always come to myself, and am sorry for the Violence of a Temper so like my dear Sister’s here: And, for this Reason, think it is no matter how few Witnesses I have of its Intemperance, while it lasts; especially since every Witness, whether they merit it or not, as you see in my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>’s Case, must be a Sufferer by it, if, unsent for, they come in my Way.</p>
<p class="indent">He repeated the same Lesson to me again, and inforc’d it; and own’d, that he was angry with me in Earnest, just then; tho’ more with himself, afterwards, for being so: But when, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said he, you wanted to transfer all my Displeasure upon yourself, it was so much braving me with your Merit, as if I must soon end my Anger, if placed there; or it was making it so light to you, that I was truly displeased. For, continued he, I cannot bear that you should wish, on any Occasion whatever, to have me angry with you, or not to value my Displeasure, as the heaviest Misfortune that could befal you.</p>
<p class="indent">But, Sir, said I, you know, that what I did was to try to reconcile my Lady, and as she herself observ’d, it was paying her a high Regard. It was so, reply’d he; but never think of making a Compliment to her, or any body living, at my Expence. Besides, she had behav’d herself so intolerably, that I began to think you had stooped too much, and more than I ought to permit my Wife to do; and Acts of Meanness are what I can’t endure in any body, but especially where I love; and as she had been guilty of a very signal one, I had much rather have renounced her, at that time, than have been reconciled to her.</p>
<p class="indent">Sir, said I, I hope I shall always comport myself so, as not wilfully to disoblige you for the future; and the rather do I hope this, as I am sure I shall want only to <em class="calibre6">know</em> your Pleasure, to <em class="calibre6">obey</em> it. But this <a id="page_443"></a>Instance shews me, that I may <em class="calibre6">much</em> offend, without designing it in the <em class="calibre6">least</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, reply’d he, don’t be too serious; I hope I shan’t be a very tyrannical Husband to you. Yet do I not pretend to be perfect, or to be always govern’d by Reason in my first Transports; and I expect, from your Affection, that you will bear with me when you find me wrong. I have no ingrateful Spirit, and can, when cool, enter as impartially into myself, as most Men; and then I am always kind and acknowledging, in proportion as I have been out of the Way.</p>
<p class="indent">But, to convince you, my Dear, continued he, of your Fault, (I mean, with regard to the Impetuosity of my Temper; for there was no Fault in your Intention, <em class="calibre6">that</em> I acknowledge) I’ll observe only, that you met, when you came to me, while I was so out of Humour, a Reception you did not expect, and a harsh Word or two, that you did not deserve. Now, had you not broken in upon me, while my Anger lasted, but stay’d till I had come to you, or sent to desire your Company, you’d have seen none of this; but that affectionate Behaviour, that, I doubt not, you’ll always merit, and I shall always take Pleasure in expressing; and in <em class="calibre6">this Temper</em> shall you always find a <em class="calibre6">proper Influence</em> over me: But you must not suppose, whenever I am out of Humour, that, in opposing yourself to my Passion, you oppose a proper Butt to it; but when you are so good, like the slender Reed, to bend to the Hurricane, rather than, like the sturdy Oak, to resist it,<a id="exp-note_103"></a><a href="part0021_split_103.html#exp-note-103" class="nounder">*</a> you will always stand firm in my kind Opinion, while a contrary Conduct would uproot you, with all your Excellencies, from my Soul.</p>
<p class="indent">Sir, said I, I will endeavour to conform myself, in all things, to your Will. I make no Doubt, but you will: And I’ll endeavour to make my Will as conformable to Reason as I can. And, let me tell you, that this Belief of you, is one of the Inducements I have had to marry at all. For nobody was more averse to this State than myself; and now we’re upon this Subject, I’ll tell you why I was so averse.</p>
<p class="indent">We People of Fortune, or such as are born to large Expectations, of both Sexes, are generally educated wrong. You have occasionally touch’d upon this, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, several times in your Journal, so justly, that I need say the less to you. We are usually so headstrong, so violent in our Wills, that we very little bear Controul.</p>
<p class="indent">Humour’d by our <em class="calibre6">Nurses</em>, thro’ the Faults of our Parents, we practise first upon them; and shew the <em class="calibre6">Gratitude</em> of our Dispositions, <a id="page_444"></a>in an Insolence that ought rather to be check’d and restrain’d, than encouraged.</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we are to be indulged in every thing at School; and our <em class="calibre6">Masters and Mistresses</em> are rewarded with further grateful Instances of our boisterous Behaviour.</p>
<p class="indent">But, in our wise Parents Eyes, all looks well, all is forgiven and excus’d; and for no other Reason, but because we are <em class="calibre6">Theirs</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Our next Progression is, we exercise our Spirits, when brought home, to the Torment and Regret of our <em class="calibre6">Parents themselves</em>, and torture their Hearts by our undutiful and perverse Behaviour to them; which, however ingrateful in us, is but the natural Consequence of their culpable Indulgence to us, from Infancy upwards.</p>
<p class="indent">And then, next, after we have, perhaps, half broken their Hearts, a <em class="calibre6">Wife</em> is look’d out for: Convenience, or Birth and Fortune, are the first Motives, Affection the last (if it is at all consulted): And two People thus educated, thus trained up in a Course of unnatural Ingratitude, and who have been headstrong Torments to every one who has had a Share in their Education, as well as to those to whom they owe their Being, are brought together; and what can be expected, but that they should pursue, and carry on, the same comfortable Conduct, in Matrimony, and join most heartily to plague one another? And, in some measure, indeed, this is right, because hereby they revenge the Cause of all those who have been aggrieved and insulted by them, upon one another.</p>
<p class="indent">The Gentleman has never been controuled: The Lady has never been contradicted.</p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre6">He</em> cannot bear it from one whose new Relation, he thinks, should oblige her to shew a quite contrary Conduct.</p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre6">She</em> thinks it very barbarous, now, for the <em class="calibre6">first</em> time, to be opposed by a Man, from whom she expected nothing but Tenderness.</p>
<p class="indent">So great is the Difference, between what they both expect <em class="calibre6">from</em> one another, and what they both find <em class="calibre6">in</em> each other, that no wonder Misunderstandings happen; that these ripen to Quarrels; that Acts of Unkindness pass, which, even had the first Motive to their Union been <em class="calibre6">Affection</em>, as usually it is not, would have effaced all manner of tender Impressions on both sides.</p>
<p class="indent">Appeals to Parents or Guardians often ensue: If, by Mediation of Friends, a Reconciliation takes place, it hardly ever holds; for why? The Fault is in the Minds of <em class="calibre6">both</em>, and <em class="calibre6">neither</em> of them will think so; <a id="page_445"></a>so that the Wound (not permitted to be probed) is but skinn’d over, and rankles still at the Bottom, and at last breaks out with more Pain and Anguish than before. Separate Beds are often the Consequence; perhaps Elopements; if not, an unconquerable Indifference, possibly Aversion. And whenever, for Appearance-sake, they are obliged to be together, every one sees, that the yawning Husband, and the vapourish Wife, are truly insupportable to one another; but, separate, have freer Spirits, and can be tolerable Company.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, my Dear, I would have you think, and, I hope, you will have no other Reason, that had I marry’d the first Lady in the Land, I would not have treated her better than I will my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>. For my Wife <em class="calibre6">is</em> my Wife; and I was the longer in resolving on the State, because I knew its Requisites, and doubted my Conduct in it.</p>
<p class="indent">I believe I am more nice than many Gentlemen; but it is because I have been a close Observer of the Behaviour of wedded Folks, and hardly have ever seen it to be such as I could like in my own Case. I shall, possibly, give you Instances, of a more particular Nature, of this, as we are <em class="calibre6">longer</em>, and, perhaps, I might say, <em class="calibre6">better</em> acquainted.</p>
<p class="indent">Had I marry’d with the Views of most Gentlemen, and with such as my good Sister (supplying the Place of my Father and Mother) would have recommended, I had wedded a fine Lady, brought up pretty much in my own Manner, and used to have her Will in every thing.</p>
<p class="indent">Some Gentlemen can come into a Compromise; and, after a few Struggles, sit down tolerably contented. But, had I marry’d a Princess, I could not have done so. I must have loved her exceedingly well, before I had consented to knit the Knot with her, and preferr’d her to all her Sex; for without this, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, Indifferences, if not Disgusts, will arise in every wedded Life, that could not have made me happy at home; and there are fewer Instances, I believe, of Mens loving better after Matrimony, than of Womens; the Reasons of which ’tis not my present Purpose to account for.</p>
<p class="indent">Then I must have been morally sure, that she preferr’d me to all Men; and, to convince me of this, she must have lessen’d, not aggravated, my Failings; she must have borne with my Imperfections; she must have watch’d and study’d my Temper; and if ever she had any Points to carry, any Desire of overcoming, it must have been by Sweetness and Complaisance; and yet not such a slavish one, as should make her Condescension seem to be rather the Effect of her Insensibility, than Judgment or Affection.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_446"></a>She should not have given Cause for any Part of my Conduct to her, to wear the least Aspect of Compulsion or Force. The Word <em class="calibre6">Command</em>, on my Side, or <em class="calibre6">Obedience</em>, on hers, I would have blotted from my Vocabulary. For this Reason I should have thought it my Duty to have desired nothing of her, that was not significant, reasonable, or just; and that then she should, on hers, have shewn no Reluctance, Uneasiness, or Doubt, to oblige me, even at half a Word.</p>
<p class="indent">I would not have excus’d her to let me twice injoin the same thing, while I took such care to make her Compliance with me reasonable, and such as should not destroy her own free Agency, in Points that ought to be allow’d her. And if I was not always right, that yet she would bear with me, if she saw me set upon it; and expostulate with me on the right side of Compliance; for that would shew me, (supposing <em class="calibre6">small Points</em> in Dispute, from which the greatest Quarrels, among <em class="calibre6">Friends</em>, generally arise) that she differ’d from me, not for <em class="calibre6">Contradiction-sake</em>, but desir’d to convince me for <em class="calibre6">my own</em>; and that I should, another time, take better Resolutions.</p>
<p class="indent">This would be so obliging a Conduct, that I should, in Justice, have doubled my Esteem for one, who, to humour me, could give up her own Judgment; and I should see she could have no other View in her Expostulations, after her Compliance had passed, than to rectify my Notions for the future; and it would have been impossible then, but I must have paid the greater Deference to her Opinion and Advice in more momentous Matters.</p>
<p class="indent">In all Companies she must have shewn, that she had, whether I deserved it altogether, or not, a high Regard and Opinion of me; and this the rather, as that such a Conduct in her, would be a Reputation and Security to herself; for if ever we Rakes attempt a marry’d Lady, our first Encouragement, exclusive of our own Vanity, arises from the indifferent Opinion, Slight, or Contempt she expresses for her Husband.</p>
<p class="indent">That therefore she would draw a kind Veil over my Faults; that such as she could not hide, she would extenuate: That she would place my better Actions in an advantageous Light, and shew, that I had <em class="calibre6">her</em> good Opinion, at least, whatever Liberties the <em class="calibre6">World</em> took with my Character.</p>
<p class="indent">She must have valued my Friends for <em class="calibre6">my</em> sake; been chearful and easy, whomever I had brought home with me; and whatever Faults she had observed in me, have never blamed me before Company; at <a id="page_447"></a>least, with such an Air of Superiority as should have shewn she had a better Opinion of her own Judgment, than mine.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, this is but a faint Sketch of the Conduct I must have expected from my Wife, let her Quality have been what it would, or have lived with her on bad Terms. Judge then, if, to me, a Lady of the modish Taste could have been tolerable.</p>
<p class="indent">The Perverseness and Contradiction I have too often seen, in some of my Visits, even among People of Sense, as well as Condition, had prejudiced me to the marry’d State; and, as I knew I could not bear it, surely I was in the right to decline it; and you see, my Dear, that I have not gone among this Class of People for a Wife; nor know I indeed, where, in any Class, I could have sought one, or had one, suitable to my Mind, if not you. For here is my Misfortune; I could not have been contented to have been <em class="calibre6">but moderately happy</em> in a Wife.</p>
<p class="indent">Judge you, from all this, if I could very well bear, that you should think yourself so well secur’d of my Affection, that you could take the Faults of others upon yourself; and, by a supposed supererogatory Merit,<a id="exp-note_104"></a><a href="part0021_split_104.html#exp-note-104" class="nounder">*</a> think your Interposition sufficient to atone for the Faults of others.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet am I not perfect myself: No, I am greatly imperfect. Yet will I not allow, that my Imperfections shall excuse those of my Wife, or make her think I ought to bear Faults in her, that she can rectify, because she bears greater from me.</p>
<p class="indent">Upon the Whole, I may expect, that you will bear with me, and study my Temper, <em class="calibre6">till</em>, and only <em class="calibre6">till</em>, you see I am capable of returning Insult for Obligation; and till you think that I shall be of a gentler Deportment, if I am roughly used, than otherwise. One thing more I will add, That I should scorn myself, if there was one Privilege of your Sex, that a Princess might expect, as my Wife, to be indulg’d in, that I would not allow to my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>. For you are the Wife of my Affections: I never wish’d for one before you, nor ever do I hope to have another!</p>
<p class="indent">I hope, Sir, said I, my future Conduct—Pardon me, said he, my Dear, for interrupting you; but it is to assure you, that I am so well convinc’d of your affectionate Regards for me, that I know I might have spared the greatest Part of what I have said: And indeed, it must be very bad for both of us, if I should have Reason to think it <em class="calibre6">necessary</em> to say so much. But one thing has brought on another; and I have rather spoken what my Niceness has made me <em class="calibre6">observe</em> in <em class="calibre6">other</em> <a id="page_448"></a>Families, than what I <em class="calibre6">fear</em> in <em class="calibre6">my own</em>. And therefore, let me assure you, I am thoroughly satisfy’d with your Conduct hitherto. You shall have no Occasion to repent it. And you shall find, tho’ greatly imperfect, and passionate, on particular Provocations, (which yet I will try to overcome) that you have not a brutal or ungenerous Husband, who is capable of offering Insult for Condescension, or returning Evil for Good.</p>
<p class="indent">I thank’d him for these kind Rules, and generous Assurances; and assured him, that they had made so much Impression on my Mind, that these, and his most agreeable Injunctions before given me, and such as he should hereafter be pleased to give me, should be so many Rules for my future Conduct.</p>
<p class="indent">And I am glad of the Method I have taken of making a Journal of all that passes in these first Stages of my Happiness, because it will sink the Impression still deeper; and I shall have recourse to them for my better Regulation, as often as I shall mistrust my Memory.</p>
<p class="indent">Let me see: What are the Rules I am to observe from this awful Lecture? Why, these:</p>
<ol class="calibre24">
<li value="1" class="calibre25">That I must not, when he is in great Wrath with any body, break in upon him, without his Leave.—<em class="calibre6">Well, I’ll remember it, I warrant. But yet I fansy this Rule is almost peculiar to himself</em>.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre25">That I must think his Displeasure the heaviest thing that can befal me. <em class="calibre6">To be sure I shall</em>.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre25">And so that I must not wish to incur it, to save any body else. <em class="calibre6">I’ll be further if I do</em>.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre25">That I must never make a Compliment to any body at his Expence.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre25">That I must not be guilty of any Acts of wilful Meanness! <em class="calibre6">There is a great deal meant in this; and I’ll endeavour to observe it all. To be sure, the Occasion on which he mentions this, explains it</em>; that I must say nothing, tho’ in Anger, that is spiteful or malicious; that is disrespectful or undutiful, <em class="calibre6">and such-like</em>.</li>
<li value="6" class="calibre25">That I must bear with him, even when I find him in the wrong. <em class="calibre6">This is a little hard, as the Case may be!</em><br class="calibre3"/>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre6">I wonder whether poor Miss</em> Sally Godfrey <em class="calibre6">be living or dead!</em></p></li>
<li value="7" class="calibre25">That I must be as flexible as the Reed in the Fable, lest, by resisting the Tempest, like the Oak, I be torn up by the Roots. <em class="calibre6">Well! I’ll do the best I can!</em>—<em class="calibre6">There is no great Likelihood, I hope, I <a id="page_449"></a>should be too perverse; yet, sure, the Tempest will not lay me quite level with the Ground neither</em>.</li>
<li value="8" class="calibre25">That the Education of young People of Condition is generally wrong. Memorandum, <em class="calibre6">That if any Part of Childrens Education fall to my Lot, I never indulge or humour them in things that they ought to be restrain’d in</em>.</li>
<li value="9" class="calibre25">That I accustom them to bear Disappointments and Controul.</li>
<li value="10" class="calibre25">That I suffer them not to be too much indulged in their Infancy.</li>
<li value="11" class="calibre25">Nor at School.</li>
<li value="12" class="calibre25">Nor spoil them when they come home.</li>
<li value="13" class="calibre25">For that Children generally extend their Perverseness from the Nurse to the Schoolmaster; from the Schoolmaster to the Parents.</li>
<li value="14" class="calibre25">And, in their next Step, as a proper Punishment for all, make their own Selves unhappy.</li>
<li value="15" class="calibre25">That undutiful and perverse Children make bad Husbands and Wives; <em class="calibre6">And, collaterally, bad Masters and Mistresses</em>.</li>
<li value="16" class="calibre25">That not being subject to be controuled early, they cannot, when marry’d, bear one another.</li>
<li value="17" class="calibre25">That the Fault lying deep, and in the Minds of each, neither will mend it.</li>
<li value="18" class="calibre25">Whence follow Misunderstandings, Quarrels, Appeals, ineffectual Reconciliations, Separations, Elopements—or, at best, Indifference; perhaps, Aversion.—Memorandum, <em class="calibre6">A good Image of unhappy Wedlock, in the Words</em> Y<small class="calibre2">AWNING</small> H<small class="calibre2">USBAND</small> <em class="calibre6">and</em> V<small class="calibre2">APOURISH</small> W<small class="calibre2">IFE</small>, <em class="calibre6">when</em> together:—<em class="calibre6">But</em> separate, <em class="calibre6">both quite alive</em>.</li>
<li value="19" class="calibre25">Few marry’d Persons behave as he likes!—<em class="calibre6">Let me ponder this with Awe and Improvement</em>.</li>
<li value="20" class="calibre25">Some Gentlemen can compromise with their Wives for Quietness-sake; but he can’t.—<em class="calibre6">Indeed I believe that’s true!</em>—<em class="calibre6">I don’t desire he should</em>.</li>
<li value="21" class="calibre25">That Love before Marriage is absolutely necessary.</li>
<li value="22" class="calibre25">That there are fewer Instances of Mens than Womens loving better after Marriage.—<em class="calibre6">But why so? I wish he had given his Reasons for this! I fansy they would not have been to the Advantage of his own Sex</em>.</li>
<li value="23" class="calibre25">That a Woman gives her Husband Reason to think she prefers him before all Men. <em class="calibre6">Well, to be sure this should be so</em>.</li>
<li value="24" class="calibre25"><a id="page_450"></a>That if she would overcome, it must be by Sweetness and Complaisance; <em class="calibre6">that is, by</em> yielding, <em class="calibre6">he means, no doubt</em>.</li>
<li value="25" class="calibre25">Yet not such a slavish one neither, as should rather seem the Effect of her Insensibility, than Judgment or Affection!</li>
<li value="26" class="calibre25">That the Words C<small class="calibre2">OMMAND</small> and O<small class="calibre2">BEY</small> shall be blotted out of his Vocabulary. <em class="calibre6">Very good!</em></li>
<li value="27" class="calibre25">That a Man should desire nothing of his Wife but what is significant, reasonable, just. <em class="calibre6">To be sure that is right</em>.</li>
<li value="28" class="calibre25">But then, that she must not shew Reluctance, Uneasiness, or Doubt, to oblige him; and that too at half a Word; and must not be bid twice to do one thing.—<em class="calibre6">But may not there be some Occasions, where this may be a little dispens’d with? But he says afterwards, indeed</em>,</li>
<li value="29" class="calibre25">That this must be only while he took care to make her Compliance reasonable, and consistent with her free Agency, in Points that ought to be allow’d her.—<em class="calibre6">Come, this is pretty well, considering</em>.</li>
<li value="30" class="calibre25">That if the Husband be <em class="calibre6">set</em> upon a wrong Thing, she must not dispute with him, but do it, and expostulate afterwards.—<em class="calibre6">Good-sirs! I don’t know what to say to this!</em>—<em class="calibre6">It looks a little hard, methinks!</em>—<em class="calibre6">This would bear a smart Debate, I fansy, in a Parliament of Women</em>.<a id="exp-note_105"></a><a href="part0021_split_105.html#exp-note-105" class="nounder">*</a>—But then he says,</li>
<li value="31" class="calibre25">Supposing they are only small Points that are in Dispute.—<em class="calibre6">Well, this mends it a little. For</em> small Points, <em class="calibre6">I think, should not be stood upon</em>.</li>
<li value="32" class="calibre25">That the greatest Quarrels among Friends, <em class="calibre6">and Wives and Husbands are or should be Friends</em>, arise from small Matters.—<em class="calibre6">I believe this is very true; for I had like to have had Anger here, when I intended very well</em>.</li>
<li value="33" class="calibre25">That a Wife should not desire to convince her Husband for C<small class="calibre2">ONTRADICTION</small> sake; but for <small class="calibre2">HIS OWN</small>. <em class="calibre6">AS</em> both <em class="calibre6">will find their Account in this, if</em> one <em class="calibre6">does; I believe ’tis very just</em>.</li>
<li value="34" class="calibre25">That in all Companies a Wife must shew Respect and Love to her Husband.</li>
<li value="35" class="calibre25">And this for the sake of her own Reputation and Security; for,</li>
<li value="36" class="calibre25">That Rakes cannot have a greater Encouragement to attempt a marry’d Lady’s Virtue, than her slight Opinion of her Husband. <em class="calibre6">To be sure, this stands to Reason, and is a fine Lesson</em>.</li>
<li value="37" class="calibre25"><a id="page_451"></a>That a Wife should therefore draw a kind Veil over her Husband’s Faults.</li>
<li value="38" class="calibre25">That such as she could not conceal, she should extenuate.</li>
<li value="39" class="calibre25">That his Virtues she should place in an Advantageous Light.</li>
<li value="40" class="calibre25">And shew the World, that he had HER good Opinion at least.</li>
<li value="41" class="calibre25">That she must value his Friends for <em class="calibre6">his</em> sake.</li>
<li value="42" class="calibre25">That she must be chearful and easy in her Behaviour, to whomsoever he brings home with him.</li>
<li value="43" class="calibre25">That whatever Faults she sees in him, she never blames him before Company.</li>
<li value="44" class="calibre25">At least, with such an Air of Superiority, as if she had a less Opinion of his Judgment than her own.</li>
<li value="45" class="calibre25">That a Man of nice Observation cannot be contented to be only <em class="calibre6">moderately</em> happy in a Wife.</li>
<li value="46" class="calibre25">That a Wife take care how she ascribe supererogatory Merit to herself; so as to take the Faults of others upon her.—<em class="calibre6">Indeed, I think it is well if we can bear our own! This is of the same Nature with the Third. And touches upon me on the present Occasion, for this wholsome Lecture</em>.</li>
<li value="47" class="calibre25">That <em class="calibre6">his</em> Imperfections must not be a Plea for <em class="calibre6">hers. To be sure, ’tis no matter how good the Women are; but ’tis to be hoped, Men will allow a little. But, indeed, he says</em>,</li>
<li value="48" class="calibre25">That a Husband who expects all this, is to be incapable of returning Insult for Obligation, or Evil for Good; and ought not to abridge her of any Privilege of her Sex.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">Well, my dear Parents, I think this last Rule crowns the rest, and makes them all very tolerable; and a generous Man, and a Man of Sense, cannot be too much obliged. And, as I have this Happiness, I shall be very unworthy, if I do not always so <em class="calibre6">think</em>, and so <em class="calibre6">act</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet, after all, you’ll see I have not the easiest Task in the World. But I know my own Intentions, that I shall not wilfully err; and so fear the less.</p>
<p class="indent">Not one Hint did he give, that I durst lay hold of, about poor Miss <em class="calibre6">Sally Godfrey</em>. I wish my Lady had not spoken of it. For it has given me a Curiosity that is not quite so pretty in me; especially so early in my Nuptials, and in a Case so long ago past. Yet he intimated too, to his Sister, that he had had other Faults, (of this Sort, I suppose) that had not come to her Knowledge!—But I make no Doubt, he has seen <a id="page_452"></a>his Error, and will be very good for the future. I wish it, and pray it may be so, for his own dear sake!</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">WEDNESDAY, the Seventh</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">WHEN I arose in the Morning, I went to wait on Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>, seeing her Door open; and she was in Bed, but awake, and talking to her Woman. I said, I hope I don’t disturb your Ladyship: No, not at all, said she; I am glad to see you. How do you?—Well, added she, when do you set out for <em class="calibre6">Bedfordshire?</em> I said, I can’t tell, Madam. It was design’d as to-day; but I have heard no more of it.</p>
<p class="indent">Sit down, said she, on the Bed-side.—I find, by the Talk we had Yesterday and last Night, you have had but a poor Time of it, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, (I must call you so yet, said she) since you was brought to this House, till within these few Days. And Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> too has given <em class="calibre6">Beck</em> such an Account, as makes me pity you.</p>
<p class="indent">Indeed, Madam, said I, if your Ladyship knew all, you <em class="calibre6">would</em> pity me; for never poor Creature was so hard put to it. But I ought to forget it all now, and be thankful.</p>
<p class="indent">Why, said she, as far as I can find, ’tis a Mercy you are here now. I was sadly moved with some part of your Story. And you have really made a noble Defence, and deserve the Praises of all our Sex.</p>
<p class="indent">It was God enabled me, Madam, reply’d I. Why, said she, ’tis the more extraordinary, because, I believe, if the Truth was known, you lov’d the Wretch not a little. While my Trials lasted, Madam, said I, I had not a <em class="calibre6">Thought</em> of <em class="calibre6">any thing</em>, but to preserve my Innocence; much less of Love.</p>
<p class="indent">But tell me truly, said she, Did you not love him all the time? I had always, Madam, answer’d I, a great Reverence for my Master, and thought all his good Actions doubly good; and for his naughty ones, tho’ I abhorr’d his Attempts upon me, yet I could not hate him; and always wish’d him well; but I did not know that it was Love. Indeed I had not the Presumption!</p>
<p class="indent">Sweet Girl! said she; that’s prettily said: But when he found he could not gain his Ends, and begun to be sorry for your Sufferings, and to admire your Virtue, and to profess honourable Love to you, What did you think?</p>
<p class="indent">Think, and please your Ladyship! I did not know what to think! I could neither hope, nor believe so great an Honour would fall to my <a id="page_453"></a>Lot; and I fear’d more from his Kindness, for some time, than I had done from his Unkindness: And having had a private Intimation, from a kind Friend, of a Sham-marriage intended, by means of a Man who was to personate a Minister, it kept my Mind in too much Suspense, to be greatly overjoy’d at his kind Declaration.</p>
<p class="indent">Said she, I think he <em class="calibre6">did</em> make two or three Attempts upon you in <em class="calibre6">Bedfordshire?</em> Yes, Madam, said I, he was very naughty, to be sure!</p>
<p class="indent">And <em class="calibre6">here</em>, he proposed Articles to you, I understand? Yes, Madam, reply’d I; but I abhorr’d so much the Thoughts of being a kept Creature, that I rejected them with great Boldness; and was resolved to die before I would consent to them.</p>
<p class="indent">He afterwards attempted you, I think; Did he not? O, yes, Madam! said I, a most sad Attempt he made; and I had like to have been lost; for Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> was not so good as she should have been. And so I told her Ladyship that sad Offer, and how I fell into Fits; and that they, believing me dying, forbore. Any Attempts after this base one? said she.</p>
<p class="indent">He was not so good as he should have been, return’d I, once, in the Garden, afterwards; but I was 50 watchful, and <em class="calibre6">so</em> ready to take the Alarm!</p>
<p class="indent">But, said she, did he not threaten you, at times, and put on his stern Airs, every now-and-then?—Threaten, Madam! reply’d I; yes, I had enough of that!—I thought I should have dy’d for Fear, several times. How could you bear that? said she: For he is a most daring and majestick Mortal! He has none of your puny Hearts, but as courageous as a Lion; and, Boy and Man, never fear’d any thing. I myself, said she, have a pretty good Spirit; but when I have made him truly angry, I have always been forced to make it up with him, as well as I could. For, Child, he is not one that is easily reconciled, I’ll assure you.</p>
<p class="indent">But, after he had profess’d honourable Love to you, Did he never attempt you again? No, indeed, Madam, he did not. But he was a good while struggling with himself, and with his Pride, as he called it, before he could stoop so low; and consider’d, and consider’d again: And once, upon my saying but two or three Words, that displeas’d him, when he was very kind to me, he turn’d me out of Doors, in a manner, at an Hour’s Warning; for he sent me above a Day’s Journey towards my Father’s; and then sent a Man and Horse, Post-haste, to fetch me back again; and has been exceedingly kind and gracious to me ever since, and made me happy.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_454"></a>That sending you away, said she, one Hour, and sending after you the next, is exactly like my Brother; and ’tis well if he don’t turn you off twice or thrice before a Year come about, if you vex him: And he would have done the same by the first Lady in the Land, if he had been marry’d to her. Yet has he his Virtues, as well as his Faults; for he is generous, nay, he is noble in his Spirit; hates little dirty Actions; he delights in doing Good: But does not pass over a wilful Fault easily. He is wise, prudent, sober and magnanimous; and will not tell a Lye, nor disguise his Faults; but you must not expect to have him all to yourself, I doubt.</p>
<p class="indent">But I’ll no more harp upon this String: You see how he was exasperated at me; and he seem’d to be angry at you too; tho’ something of it was Art, I believe.</p>
<p class="indent">Indeed, Madam, said I, he has been pleased to give me a most noble Lecture; and I find he was angry with me in Earnest, and that it will not be an easy Task to behave unexceptionably to him: For he is very nice and delicate in his Notions, I perceive; but yet, as your Ladyship says, exceeding generous.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, says she, I’m glad thou hadst a little bit of his Anger, else I should have thought it Art; and I don’t love to be treated with low Art, any more than he; and I should have been vex’d, if he had done it by me.</p>
<p class="indent">But I understand, Child, says she, that you keep a Journal of all Matters that pass, and he has several times found means to get at it: Should you care I should see it? It could not be to your Disadvantage; for I find it had no small Weight with <em class="calibre6">him</em> in your Favour; and I should take great Pleasure to read all his Stratagems, Attempts, Contrivances, Menaces, and Offers to you, on one hand; and all your pretty Counter-plottings, which he much praises, your resolute Resistance, and the noble Stand you have made to preserve your Virtue; and the Steps by which his Pride was subdued, and his Mind induced to honourable Love, till you were made what you now are: For it must be a rare, an uncommon Story; and will not only give me great Pleasure in reading, but will intirely reconcile me to the Step he has taken. And that, let me tell you, is what I never thought to be; for I had gone a great way in bringing about a Match with him and Lady <em class="calibre6">Betty</em>——; and had said so much of it, that the Earl, her Father, approv’d of it; and so did the Duke of——, her Uncle; and Lady <em class="calibre6">Betty</em> herself was not averse: And now shall I be hunted to <a id="page_455"></a>Death about it; and this has made me so outrageous as you have seen me upon the Matter. But when I can find, by your Writings, that your Virtue is but suitably rewarded, it will be not only a good Excuse for me, but for him, and make me love you.</p>
<p class="indent">There is nothing that I would not do, said I, to oblige your Ladyship; but my poor Father and Mother (who would rather have seen me buried quick in the Earth, than to be seduced by the greatest of Princes) have them in their Hands at present; and your dear Brother has bespoken them, when they have done reading them; but if he gives me Leave, I will shew them to your Ladyship with all my Heart; not doubting your generous Allowances, as I have had his; tho’ I have treated him very freely all the way, while he had naughty Views; and that your Ladyship would consider them as the naked Sentiments of my Heart, from Time to Time, deliver’d to those, whose Indulgence I was sure of; and for whose Sight, only, they were written.</p>
<p class="indent">Give me a Kiss now, said her Ladyship, for your chearful Compliance; for I make no doubt my Brother will consent I shall see them, because they must needs make for <em class="calibre6">your</em> Honour; and I see he loves you better than any one in the World.</p>
<p class="indent">I have heard, continued her Ladyship, a mighty good Character of your Parents, as industrious, honest, sensible, good Folks, who know the World; and, as I doubt not my Brother’s Generosity, I am glad they will make no ill Figure in the World’s Eye.</p>
<p class="indent">Madam, said I, they are the honestest, the lovingest, and the most conscientious Couple breathing. They once lived creditably; brought up a great Family, of which I am the youngest; but had Misfortunes, thro’ their doing beyond their Power for two unhappy Brothers, who are both dead, and whose Debts they stood bound for, and so became reduced, and, by harsh Creditors, (where most of the Debts were not of their own contracting) turn’d out of all; and having, without Success, try’d to set up a little Country School, (for my Father understood a little of Accompts, and wrote a pretty good Hand) forced to take to hard Labour; but honest all the Time; contented; never repining; and loving to one another; and, in the midst of their Poverty and Disappointments, above all Temptation; and all their Fear was, that I should be wicked, and yield to Temptation, for the sake of worldly Riches: And to God’s Grace, and their good Lessons, and those I imbib’d from my dear good Lady, your Ladyship’s <a id="page_456"></a>Mother, it is that I owe the Preservation of my Innocence, and the happy Station I now am exalted to.</p>
<p class="indent">She was pleased to kiss me again, and said, There is such a noble Simplicity in thy Story, such an honest Artlesness in thy Mind, and such a sweet Humility in thy Deportment, notwithstanding thy present Station, that I believe I shall be forced to love thee, whether I will or not: And the Sight of your Papers, I dare say, will crown the Work, will disarm my Pride, banish my Resentment on Lady <em class="calibre6">Betty</em>’s account, and justify my Brother’s Conduct; and, at the same time, redound to your own everlasting Honour, as well as to the Credit of our Sex: And so I make no doubt but my Brother will let me see them.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Worden</em>, said my Lady, I can say any thing before you; and you will take no Notice of our Conversation; but I see you are much touched with it: Did you ever hear any thing prettier, more unaffected, sincere, free, easy?—No, never, Madam, answer’d she, in my Life; and it is a great Pleasure, to see so happy a Reconciliation taking Place, where there is so much Merit.</p>
<p class="indent">I said, I have discover’d so much Prudence in Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Worden</em>, that, as well for that, as for the Confidence your Ladyship places in her, I have made no Scruple of speaking my Mind freely before her; and of blaming my dear Master, while he was blame-worthy, as well as acknowledging his transcendent Goodness to me since; which, I am sure, exceeds all I can ever deserve. May-be not, said my Lady. I hope you’ll be very happy in one another; and I’ll now rise, and tell him my Thoughts, and ask him to let me have the reading of your Papers; for I promise myself much Pleasure in them; and shall not grudge a Journey, and a Visit to you, to the other House, to fetch them.</p>
<p class="indent">Your Ladyship’s Favour, said I, was all I had to wish for; and if I have that, and the Continuance of your dear Brother’s Goodness to me, I shall be easy under whatever else may happen.</p>
<p class="indent">And so I took my Leave, and withdrew; and she let me hear her say to Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Worden</em>, ’Tis a charming Creature, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Worden!</em>—I know not which excels, her Person or her Mind!—And so young a Creature too!—Well may my Brother love her!</p>
<p class="indent">I am afraid, my dear Father and Mother, I shall now be too proud indeed.—I had once a good mind to have asked her Ladyship about Miss <em class="calibre6">Sally Godfrey;</em> but I thought it was better let alone, as she did <a id="page_457"></a>not mention it herself. May-be, I shall hear it too soon. But I hope not!—I wonder, tho’, whether she be living or dead!</p>
<p class="indent">We breakfasted together with great good Temper; and my Lady was very kind, and asking my good Master, he gave Leave, very readily, she should see all my Papers, when you return’d them to me; and he said, He was sure, when she came to read them, she would say, that I had well deserv’d the Fortune I had met with, and would be of Opinion, that, all the Kindness of his future Life would hardly be a sufficient Reward for my Virtue, and make me Amends for my Sufferings.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">My Lady resolving to set out the next Morning, to return to her Lord, my Master order’d every thing to be made ready for his doing the like, to <em class="calibre6">Bedfordshire;</em> and this Evening our good Neighbours will sup with us, to take Leave of my Lady and us.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">WEDNESDAY Night</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">Nothing particular having passed at Dinner and Supper, but the most condescending Goodness, on my Lady’s side, to me; and the highest Civilities from Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em>’s Family; from Lady <em class="calibre6">Jones</em>, from Sir <em class="calibre6">Simon</em>’s Family, &amp;<em class="calibre6">c</em>. and reciprocal good Wishes all round; and a Promise obtained from my Benefactor, that he would endeavour to pass a Fortnight or three Weeks in these Parts, before the Winter set in; I shall conclude this Day with observing, that I disposed of the Money my Master was so good to put into my Hands, in the Method he was pleased to direct; and I gave Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> hers, in such a manner, as highly pleased her; and she wished me, with Tears, all kind of Happiness; and pray’d me to forgive her all her past Wickedness to me, as she herself called it. I begg’d Leave of my Master to present Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Worden</em> with Five Guineas, for a Pair of Gloves; which he said was well thought of.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">SATURDAY</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">ON <em class="calibre6">Thursday</em> Morning my Lady set out for her own Seat; and my good Sir and I, attended by Mr. <em class="calibre6">Colbrand, Abraham</em> and <em class="calibre6">Thomas</em>, for this dear House. Her Ladyship parted with her Brother and me with great Tenderness, and made me promise to send her my Papers; which I find she intends to entertain Lady <em class="calibre6">Betty</em> with, and another <a id="page_458"></a>Lady or two, her Intimates, as also her Lord; and hopes to find, as I believe, in the Reading of them, some Excuse for her Brother’s Choice.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">My dearest Master has been all Love and Tenderness on the Road, as he is in every Place, and on every Occasion. And Oh! what a delightful Change was this Journey, to that which, so contrary to all my Wishes, and so much to my Apprehensions, carry’d me hence to the <em class="calibre6">Lincolnshire</em> House! And how did I bless God at every Turn, and at every Stage!</p>
<p class="indent">We did not arrive here till yesterday Noon. <em class="calibre6">Abraham</em> rode before, to let them know we were coming. And I had the Satisfaction to find every body there I wished to see. When the Chariot enter’d the Court-yard, I was so strongly impress’d with the Favour and Mercies of God Almighty, on remembring how I was sent away the last time I saw this House; the Leave I took; the Dangers I had encounter’d; a poor cast-off Servant Girl; and now returning a joyful Wife, and the Mistress, thro’ his Favour, of the noble House I was turn’d out of; that I was hardly able to support the Joy I felt in my Mind on the Occasion. He saw how much I was moved, and tenderly ask’d me, why I seem’d so affected? I told him, and lifted his dear Hand to my Lips, and said, O, Sir! God’s Mercies, and your Goodness to me, on entering this dear, dear Place, are above my Expression! I can hardly bear the Thoughts of them!—He said, Welcome, thrice welcome, Joy of my Life! to your own House: And kissed my Hand in Return. All the common Servants stood at the Windows, as unseen as they could, to observe us. He took my Hand, with the most condescending Goodness in the World, and, with great Complaisance, led me into the Parlour, and kissed me with the greatest Ardour. Welcome again, my dearest Spouse, said he, a thousand times welcome, to the Possession of a House that is not more mine than yours.</p>
<p class="indent">I threw myself at his Feet: Permit me, dear Sir, thus to bless <em class="calibre6">God</em>, and thank <em class="calibre6">you</em>, for all <em class="calibre6">his</em> Mercies, and <em class="calibre6">your</em> Goodness. O may I so behave, as not to be <em class="calibre6">utterly unworthy;</em> and then how <em class="calibre6">happy</em> shall I be! God give me, my Dearest, said he, Life and Health to reward all your Sweetness: And no Man can be then so blest as I!</p>
<p class="indent">Where (said he to <em class="calibre6">Abraham</em>, who passed by the Door, Where) is Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis?</em>—She bolted in! Here, good Sir, said she, here, good Madam, am I, waiting impatiently, till called for, to congratulate you <a id="page_459"></a>both!—I ran to her, and clasp’d my Arms about her Neck, and kissed her: O my dear Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis!</em> said I, my other dear Mother! receive your happy, happy, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>: And join with me to bless God, and bless our Master, for all these great Things!—I was ready to sink into her Arms thro’ Excess of Joy, to see the dear good Woman, who had been so often a mournful Witness of my Distress, as now of my Triumph!—Dearest Madam, said she, you do me too much Honour. Let my whole Life shew the Joy I take in your deserv’d good Fortune, and in my Duty to you, for the early Instance I received of your Goodness in your kind Letter. O, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>, reply’d I, <em class="calibre6">There</em> all Thanks are due, both from you and me: For our dear Master granted me this Blessing, as I may justly call it, the very first Moment I begg’d it of him. Your Goodness, Sir, said she, I will for ever acknowledge; and I beg Pardon for the wrong Step I made, in applying to my Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>.—He was so good as to salute her, and said, All’s over now, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis;</em> and I shall not remember you <em class="calibre6">ever</em> disoblig’d me. I always respected you, and shall now, more and more, value you, for the sake of that dear good Creature, that, with Joy unfeign’d, I can call my Wife. God bless your Honour, for ever! said she; and many, <em class="calibre6">many</em> happy Years may ye live together, the Envy and Wonder of all who know you!</p>
<p class="indent">But where, said my dear Master, is honest <em class="calibre6">Longman?</em> and where is <em class="calibre6">Jonathan?</em>—Come, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>, said I, you shall shew me them, and all the good Folks, presently; and let me go up with you to behold the dear Apartments, which I have seen <em class="calibre6">before</em> with such different Emotions to what I shall <em class="calibre6">now</em> do.</p>
<p class="indent">We went up; and in every Room, the Chamber I took Refuge in, when my Master pursu’d me, my Lady’s Chamber, her Dressing-room, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>’s Room, not forgetting her Closet, my own little Bed-chamber, the Green-room, and in each of the others, I kneeled down severally, and blessed God for my past Escapes, and present Happiness; and the good Woman was quite affected with the Zeal and Pleasure with which I made my thankful Acknowledgments to the Divine Goodness. O my excellent Lady! said she, you are still the same good, pious, humble Soul I knew you; and your Marriage has added to your Graces, as I hope it will to your Blessings.</p>
<p class="indent">Dear Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>, said I, you know not what I have gone thro’! You know not what God has done for me! You know not what a happy Creature I am now! I have a thousand, thousand things to tell you; <a id="page_460"></a>and a whole Week would be too little, every Moment of it spent in relating to you what has befallen me, to make you acquainted with it all. We shall be sweetly happy together, I make no doubt. But I charge you, my dear Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>, whatever you call me before Strangers, that when we are by ourselves, you call me nothing but <em class="calibre6">your Pamela</em>. For what an ingrateful Creature should I be, who have receiv’d so many Mercies at the Hand of God, if I attributed them not to his Divine Goodness, but assumed to myself insolent Airs upon them! No, I hope, I shall be more and more thankful, as I am more and more blest; and more humble, as God, the Author of all my Happiness, shall more distinguish me.</p>
<p class="indent">We went down again to the Parlour, to my dear Master. Said he, Call in again Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman;</em> he longs to see you, my Dear. He came in: God bless you, my sweet Lady, said he; as now, God be praised, I may call you. Did I not tell you, Madam, that Providence would find you out? O, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>, said I, God be praised for all his Mercies!—I am rejoiced to see you; and I laid my Hand on his, and said, Good Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>, how do you do!—I must always value you; and you don’t know how much of my present Happiness I owe to the Sheets of Paper, and Pens and Ink you furnish’d me with. I hope, my dear Sir and you are quite reconciled.—O Madam, said he, how good you are!—Why, I cannot contain myself for Joy! and then he wiped his Eyes, good Man!</p>
<p class="indent">Said my Master, Yes, I have been telling Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>, that I am obliged to him for his ready Return to me; and that I will intirely forget his Appeal to Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers;</em> and I hope he’ll find himself quite as easy and happy as he wishes.—My Partner here, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>, I dare promise you, will do all she can to make you so. God bless you both together! said he. ’Tis the Pride of my Heart to see this!—I return’d with double Delight, when I heard the blessed News; and I am sure, Sir, said he, mark old <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>’s Words, God will bless you for this every Year more and more!—You don’t know how many Hearts you have made happy by this generous Deed!—I am glad of it, said my dear Master; I am sure I have made my own happy: And, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>, tho’ I must think you S<small class="calibre2">OMEBODY</small>, yet, as you are not a young Man, and so won’t make me jealous, I can allow you to wish my dear Wife Joy in the tenderest manner. Adad, Sir, said he, I am sure you rejoice me with your Favour: ’Twas what I long’d for, but durst not presume. My Dear, said my Master, receive the <a id="page_461"></a>Compliment of one of the honestest Hearts in <em class="calibre6">England</em>, that always rever’d your Virtues!—And the good Man saluted me with great Respect; and said, God in Heaven bless you both, and kneeled on one Knee. I must quit your Presence! Indeed I must!—And away he went.</p>
<p class="indent">Your Goodness, Sir, said I, knows no Bounds! O may my Gratitude never find any!—I saw, said my Master, when the good Man approach’d you, that he did it with so much Awe and Love mingled together, that I fansied he long’d to salute my Angel; and I could not but indulge his honest Heart. How bless’d am I, said I, and kiss’d his Hand—And indeed I make nothing now of kissing his dear Hand, as if it was my own!</p>
<p class="indent">When honest old Mr. <em class="calibre6">Jonathan</em> came in to attend at Dinner, so clean, so sleek, and so neat, as he always is, with his silver Hair, I said, Well, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Jonathan</em>, how do you? I am glad to see you?—You look as well as ever, thank God! O dear, Madam! said he, better than ever, to have such a blessed Sight!—God bless you and my good Master!—and I hope, Sir, said he, you’ll excuse all my past Failings. Ay, that I will, <em class="calibre6">Jonathan</em>, said he; because you never had any, but what your Regard for my dear Spouse here was the Occasion of. And now I can tell you, you can never err, because you cannot respect her too much. O Sir, said he, your Honour is exceeding good. I’m sure I shall always pray for you both.</p>
<p class="indent">After Dinner Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em> coming in, and talking of some Affairs under his Care, he said afterwards, All your Honour’s Servants are now happy; for <em class="calibre6">Robert</em>, who left you, had a pretty little Fortune fallen to him, or he never would have quitted your Service. He was here but Yesterday, to enquire when you and my Lady return’d hither; and hop’d he might have Leave to pay his Duty to you both. Ay, said my Master, I shall be glad to see honest <em class="calibre6">Robin;</em> for that’s another of your Favourites, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>.—<em class="calibre6">It</em> was high time, I think, I should marry you, were it but to engage the Respects of all my Family to myself. There are, Sir, said I, ten thousand Reasons why I should rejoice in your Goodness.</p>
<p class="indent">But I was going to say, said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>, That all your Honour’s old Servants are now happy, but one. You mean <em class="calibre6">John Arnold?</em> said my Master. I do, indeed, said he, if you’ll excuse me, Sir. O said I, I have had my Prayer for poor <em class="calibre6">John</em> answer’d, as favourably as I could wish.—Why, said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>, to be sure poor <em class="calibre6">John</em> has acted no very good Part, take it all together; but he so much honour’d you, <a id="page_462"></a>Sir, and so much respected you, Madam, that he would have been glad to have been obedient to both; and so was faithful to neither. But indeed the poor Fellow’s Heart’s almost broke, and he won’t look out for any other Place; and says, he must live in your Honour’s Service, or he must die wretched very shortly. Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em> was there when this was said; Indeed, says she, the poor Man has been here every Day since he heard the Tidings that have rejoiced us all; and he says, he hopes he shall yet be forgiven. Is he in the House now? said my Master. He is, Sir; and was here when your Honour came in, and play’d at hide-and-seek to have one Look at you both when you alighted; and was ready to go out of his Wits for Joy, when he saw your Honour hand my Lady in. <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said my dear Master, you’re to do with <em class="calibre6">John</em> as you please. You have full Power. Then pray Sir, said I, let poor <em class="calibre6">John</em> come in.</p>
<p class="indent">The poor Fellow came in, with so much Confusion, that I have never seen a Countenance that express’d so lively Consciousness of his Faults, and mingled Joy and Shame. How do you do, <em class="calibre6">John?</em> said I; I hope you’re very well!—The poor Fellow could hardly speak, and look’d with Awe upon my Master, and Pleasure upon me. Said my Master, Well, <em class="calibre6">John</em>, there is no room to say any thing to a Man that has so much Concern already: I am told you will serve me whether I will or not; but I turn you over altogether to my Spouse here. And she is to do by you as she pleases. You see, <em class="calibre6">John</em>, said I, your good Master’s Indulgence. Well may I forgive, that have so generous an Example. I was always persuaded of your honest Intentions, if you had known how to distinguish between your Duty to your Master, and your Good-will to me: You will now have no more Puzzles on that Account, from the Goodness of your dear Master. I shall be but too happy said the poor Man. God bless your Honour! God bless you, Madam!—I now have the Joy of my Soul, in serving you both; and I will make the best of Servants, to my Power. Well then, <em class="calibre6">John</em>, said I, your Wages will go on, as if you had not left your Master: May I not say so, Sir? said I. Yes, surely, my Dear, reply’d he, and augment them too, if you find his Duty to you deserves it. A thousand Million of Thanks, said the poor Man: I am very well satisfy’d, and desire no Augmentation; and so he withdrew overjoy’d; and Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em> and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em> were highly pleas’d; for tho’ they were incens’d against him for his Fault to me, when Matters look’d badly for me, yet they, and all his Fellow-servants, always lov’d <em class="calibre6">John</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_463"></a>When Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em> and Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em> had din’d, they came in again, to know if he had any Commands; and my dear Master filling a Glass of Wine, said, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>, I am going to toast the happiest and honestest Couple in <em class="calibre6">England</em>, my dear <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>’s Father and Mother.—Thank you, dear Sir, said I.</p>
<p class="indent">Said he, I think that little <em class="calibre6">Kentish</em> Purchase wants a Manager; and as it is a little out of <em class="calibre6">your</em> Way, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>, I have been purposing, if I thought Mr. <em class="calibre6">Andrews</em> would accept of it, that he should enter upon <em class="calibre6">Hodges</em>’s Farm, that was, and so manage for me that whole little Affair; and we will well stock the Farm for him, and make it comfortable; and I think, if he will take that Trouble upon him, it will be an Ease to you, and a Favour to me.</p>
<p class="indent">Your Honour, said he, cannot do a better thing; and I have had some Inkling given me, that you might, if you pleased, augment that Estate, by a Purchase, of equal Amount, contiguous to it; and as you have so much Money to spare, I can’t see your Honour can do better. Well, said he, let me have the Particulars another time, and we will consider about it. But my Dear, added he, you’ll mention this to your Father, if you please.</p>
<p class="indent">I have too much Money, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>, continu’d he, lies useless; tho’, upon this Occasion, I shall not grudge laying out as much in Liveries, and other things, as if I had marry’d a Lady of a Fortune equal, if possible, to my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>’s Merit; and I reckon you have a good deal in Hand. Yes, Sir, said he, more than I wish I had. But I have a Mortgage in View, if you don’t buy that <em class="calibre6">Kentish</em> thing, that I believe will answer very well; and when Matters are riper, will mention it to your Honour.</p>
<p class="indent">I took with me to <em class="calibre6">Lincolnshire</em>, said my Master, upwards of Six hundred Guineas, and thought to have laid most of them out there (Thank God, thought I, you did not! for he offer’d me Five hundred of them, you know!) But I have not laid out above Two hundred and fifty of them; so Two hundred I left there in my Escritoire; because I shall go again for a Fortnight or so, before Winter; and Two hundred I have brought with me. And I have Money, I know not what, in three Places here; the Account of which is in my Pocket-book, in my Library.</p>
<p class="indent">You have made some little Presents, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, to my Servants there, on our Nuptials; and these Two hundred that I have brought up, I will put into your Disposal, that, with some of them, you shall do here as you did there.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_464"></a>I am asham’d, good Sir, said I, to be so costly and so worthless! Pray, my Dear, said he, say not a Word of that.</p>
<p class="indent">Said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>, Why, Madam, with Money in Stocks, and one thing or another, his Honour could buy half the Gentlemen round him. He wants not Money, and lays up every Year. And it would have been pity, but his Honour should have wedded just as he has. Very true, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>, said my Master; and pulling out his Purse, said, Tell out, my Dear, Two hundred Guineas, and give me the rest.—I did so. Now, said he, take them yourself, for the Purposes I mentioned. But, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>, do you, before Sun-set, bring my dear Girl Fifty Pounds, which is due to her this Day, by my Promise; and every three Months, from this Day, pay her Fifty Pounds more; which will be Two hundred Pounds <em class="calibre6">per Annum;</em> and this is for her to lay out at her own Discretion, and without Account, in such a way, as shall derive a Blessing upon us all: For she was my Mother’s Almoner, and shall be mine, and her own too.—I’ll go for it this Instant, said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">When he was gone, I looked upon my dear generous Master, and on Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis;</em> and he gave me a Nod of Assent; and I took Twenty Guineas, and said, Dear Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>, accept of this; which is no more than my generous Master order’d me to present to Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, for a pair of Gloves, on my happy Nuptials, and so you, who are so much better intitled to them, by the Love I bear you, must not refuse them.</p>
<p class="indent">Said she, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em> was on the Spot, Madam, at the happy Time. Yes, said my Master, but <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> would have rejoiced to have had you there instead of her. That I should, Sir, reply’d I, or instead of any body except my own Mother. She gratefully accepted them, and thank’d us both: But I don’t know what she should thank <em class="calibre6">me</em> for; for I was not worth a fourth Part of them myself.</p>
<p class="indent">I’d have you, my Dear, said he, in some handsome manner, as you know how, oblige <em class="calibre6">Longman</em> to accept of the like Present.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em> return’d from his Office, and brought me the fifty Pounds, saying, I have enter’d this new Article with great Pleasure. <em class="calibre6">To my Lady</em>—<em class="calibre6">Fifty Pounds, to be paid the same Sum quarterly</em>. O Sir, said I, what will become of me to be so poor in myself, and so rich in your Bounty.—It is a Shame to take all that your profuse Goodness would heap upon me thus: But indeed it shall not be without <a id="page_465"></a>Account.—Make no Words, my Dear, said he. Are you not my Wife? And have I not endow’d you with my Goods? and, hitherto, this is a very small Part.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>, said I, and Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>, you both see how I am even oppress’d with unreturnable Obligations. God bless the Donor, and God bless the Receiver! said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman;</em> I am sure they will bring back good Interest; for, Madam, you had ever a bountiful Heart; and I have seen the Pleasure you used to take to dispense my late Lady’s Alms and Donations.</p>
<p class="indent">I’ll warrant, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>, said I, notwithstanding you are so willing to have me take large Sums for nothing at all, I should affront you, if I asked you to accept from me a Pair of Gloves only, on Account of my happy Nuptials. He seem’d not readily to know how to answer, and my Master said, If Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em> refuse you, my Dear, he may be said to refuse your first Favour. On that I put twenty Guineas in his Hand; but he insisted upon it, that he would take but Five. I said, I must desire you to oblige me, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>, or I shall think I have affronted you. Well, if I must, said he, I know what I know. What is that, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>, said I?—Why, Madam, said he, I will not lay it out till my young Master’s Birth Day, which I hope will be within this Twelve-month.</p>
<p class="indent">Not expecting any thing like this from the old Gentleman, I look’d at my Master, and then blush’d so, I could not hold up my Head. Charmingly said, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>, said my Master, and clasped me in his Arms; O my dear Life! God send it may be so.—You have quite delighted me, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman!</em> Tho’ I durst not have said such a Thing for the World.—Madam, said the old Gentleman, I beg your Pardon; I hope no Offence. But I’d speak it ten times in a Breath to have it so, take it how you please, as long as my good Master takes it so well. Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>, said my Master, this is an over-nice dear Creature; you don’t know what a Life I have had with her, even on this side Matrimony.—Said Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>, I think Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em> says very well; I am sure I shall hope for it too.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>, who had struck me of a Heap, withdrawing soon after, my Master said, Why, My Dear, you can’t look up! The old Man said nothing shocking. I did not expect it, tho’, from him, said I. I was not aware but of some innocent Pleasantry. Why, so it was, said he, both innocent and pleasant. And I won’t forgive you, if you don’t say as he says. Come, speak before Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>. May every <a id="page_466"></a>thing happen, Sir, said I, that will give <em class="calibre6">you</em> Delight!—That’s my dear Love, said he, and kiss’d me with great Tenderness.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">When the Servants had dined, I desired to see the Maidens, and all Four came up together. You are welcome home, Madam, said <em class="calibre6">Rachel;</em> We rejoice all to see you here, and more to see you our Lady. O my good old Acquaintances, said I, you see how good God, and the best of Gentlemen have been to me! O I joy to see you! How do you do, <em class="calibre6">Rachel?</em> How do you, <em class="calibre6">Jane?</em> How do you do, <em class="calibre6">Hannah?</em> How do you do, <em class="calibre6">Cicely?</em> And I took each of them by the Hand, and could have kissed them.—For, said I to myself, I kissed you all last time I saw you, in Sorrow; why should I not kiss you all with Joy? But I forbore in Honour of their dear Master’s Presence.</p>
<p class="indent">They seem’d quite transported with me; and my good Master was pleas’d with the Scene. See here, my Lasses, said he, your Mistress! I need not bid you respect her; for you always lov’d her; and she’ll have it as much in her Power as Inclincation to be kind to the Deserving. Indeed, said I, I shall always be a kind Friend to you; and your dear good Master, has order’d me to give each of you this, that you may rejoice with me, on my Happiness. And so I gave them five Guineas a-piece; and said God bless you every one. I am over-joy’d to see you!—And they withdrew with the greatest Gratitude and Pleasure, praying for us both.</p>
<p class="indent">I turn’d to my dear Master, ’Tis to you, dear Sir, said I, next to God, who put it into your generous Heart, that all my Happiness is owing! That my Mind thus overflows with Joy and Gratitude! And I would have kissed his Hand; but he clasped me in his Arms, and said, You deserve it, my Dear! You deserve it all. Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em> came in; said she, I have seen a very affecting Sight; you have made your Maidens quite happy, Madam, with your Kindness and Condescension! I saw them all Four, as I came by the Hall Door, just got up from their Knees, praising and praying for you both! Dear good Bodies, said I; and did <em class="calibre6">Jane</em> pray too? God return their Prayers upon themselves, I say.</p>
<p class="indent">My Master sent for <em class="calibre6">Jonathan</em>, and I held up all the Fingers of my two Hands; and my Master giving a Nod of Approbation as he came in, I said, Well, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Jonathan</em>, I could not be satisfy’d without seeing you in Form, as it were, and thanking you for all your past Good-will to me. You’ll accept of <em class="calibre6">that</em> for a Pair of Gloves, on this happy <a id="page_467"></a>Occasion; and I gave him ten Guineas, and took his honest Hand between both mine: God bless you, said I, with your Silver Hairs, so like my dear Father!—I shall always value such a good old Servant of the best of Masters!—He said, O such Goodness! Such kind Words!—It is Balm to my Heart! Blessed be God I have lived to this Day!—And his Eyes swam in Tears, and he withdrew.—My Dear, said my Master, you make every one happy!—O Sir, said I, ’tis you, ’tis you; and let my grateful Heart always spring to my Lips, to acknowledge the Blessings you heap upon me.</p>
<p class="indent">Then in came <em class="calibre6">Harry</em>, and <em class="calibre6">Isaac</em>, and <em class="calibre6">Benjamin</em>, and the two Grooms of this House, and <em class="calibre6">Arthur</em> the Gardener, for my dear Master had order’d them by Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em> thus to be marshall’d out; and he said, Where’s <em class="calibre6">John?</em> Poor <em class="calibre6">John</em> was asham’d, and did not come in till he heard himself call’d for. I said to them, How do you do, <em class="calibre6">Henry?</em> How do you do, <em class="calibre6">Isaac?</em> How do you do, <em class="calibre6">Benjamin?</em> How do you do, <em class="calibre6">Arthur?</em> And you, and you, <em class="calibre6">Richard</em> and <em class="calibre6">Roger?</em> God bless you every one. My Master said, I have given you a Mistress, my Lads, that is the Joy of my Heart. You see her Goodness and Condescension! Let your Respects to her be but answerable, and she’ll be proportionably as great a Blessing to you all as she is to me. <em class="calibre6">Harry</em> said, In the Names of all your Servants, Sir, I bless your Honour and your good Lady: And it shall be all our Studies to deserve her Ladyship’s Favour, as well as your Honour’s. And so I gave every one five Guineas, to rejoice, as I said, in my Happiness.</p>
<p class="indent">When I came to <em class="calibre6">John</em>, I said, I saw you before, <em class="calibre6">John;</em> but I again tell you, I am glad to see you. He said, he was quite asham’d and confounded. O, said I, forget every thing that’s past, <em class="calibre6">John</em>!—Your dear good Master will, and so will I. For God has wonderfully brought about all these Things, by the very Means I once thought most grievous. Let us therefore look forward, and be only asham’d to commit Faults for the Time to come. For they may not always be attended with like happy Consequences.</p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre6">Arthur</em>, said my Master, I have brought you a Mistress that is a great Gardener. She’ll shew you a new Way to plant Beans. And never anybody had such a Hand at improving a Sun-flower, as she! — O Sir, Sir, said I; but yet a little dash’d; all my Improvements in every kind of Thing are owing to you, I am sure!—And so I think I was even with the dear Man, and yet appear’d grateful before his Servants. They withdrew, blessing us both, as the rest had done.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_468"></a>And then came in the Postilion, and two Helpers, (for my Master has both here, and at <em class="calibre6">Lincolnshire</em>, fine Hunting-horses, and it is the chief Sport he takes Delight in) as also the Scullion-boy; And I said, How do you, all of you? And how dost do, <em class="calibre6">Tommy?</em> I hope you’re very good. Here, your dear Master has order’d you something a piece, in Honour of me. And my Master holding three Fingers to me, I gave the Postilion and Helpers three Guineas each, and the little Boy two; and bid him let his poor Mother lay it out for him, for he must not spend it idly. Mr. <em class="calibre6">Colbrand, Abraham</em> and <em class="calibre6">Thomas</em>, I had before presented at t’other House.</p>
<p class="indent">And when they were all gone, but Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>, I said, And now, dearest Sir, permit me on my Knees, thus, to bless you, and pray for you. And Oh, may God crown you with Length of Days, and Increase of Honour; and may your happy, happy <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, by her grateful Heart, appear always worthy in your dear Eyes, tho’ she cannot be so in her own, nor in those of any others!</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>, said my Master, you see the Excellency of this sweet Creature! And when I tell you, that the Charms of her Person, all lovely as she is, bind me not so strongly to her as the Graces of her Mind, congratulate me, that my Happiness is built on so stable a Basis!—Indeed I do, most sincerely, Sir, said she!—This is a happy Day to me.</p>
<p class="indent">I stept into the Library, while he was thus pouring out his Kindness for me to Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis;</em> and bless’d God there on my Knees, for the Difference I now found to what I had once known in it.—And when I have done the same in the first Scene of my Fears, the once frightful Summer-house, I shall have gone thro’ most of my distressful Scenes with Gratitude; but shall never forbear thanking God in my Mind, for his Goodness to me in every one. Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em> I find, had whisper’d him what I had done above, and he saw me on my Knees, with my Back towards him, unknown to me; but softly put to the Door again, as he had open’d it a little Way. And I said, not knowing he had seen me, You have some charming Pictures here, Sir:—Yes, said he, my dear Life, so I have; but none equal to that, which your Piety affords me!—And may the God you delight to serve bless more and more my dear Angel. Sir, said I, you are all Goodness!—I hope, reply’d he, after your sweet Example, I shall be better and better!—Do you think, my dear Father and Mother, there ever was so happy a Creature as I! To be sure it would be very <a id="page_469"></a>ingrateful to think with Uneasiness, or any thing but Compassion, of poor Miss <em class="calibre6">Sally Godfrey</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">He order’d <em class="calibre6">Jonathan</em> to let the Evening be pass’d merrily, but wisely, as he said, with what every one liked, whether Wine or <em class="calibre6">October</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">He was pleased afterwards to lead me up Stairs, and gave me Possession of my Lady’s Dressing-room and Cabinet, and her fine Repeating-watch and Equipage; and in short of a complete Set of Diamonds, that were his good Mother’s; as also of the two Pair of Diamond Ear-rings, the two Diamond Rings, and Diamond Necklace he mention’d in his naughty Articles, which her Ladyship had intended for Presents to Miss <em class="calibre6">Tomlins</em>, a rich Heiress that was proposed for his Wife, when he was just come from his Travels; but which went off, after all was agreed upon on both the Friends Sides, because he approv’d not her Conversation; and she had, as he told his Mother, too masculine an Air; and he never could be brought to see her but once, tho’ the Lady lik’d him very well. He presented me also with her Ladyship’s Books, Pictures, Linnen, Laces, <em class="calibre6">&amp;c</em>. that were in her Apartments, and bid me call those Apartments mine. O give me, my good God, Humility and Gratitude!</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">SUNDAY Night</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">THIS Day, as Matters could not be ready for our Appearance at a better Place, we staid at home; and my dear Master imploy’d himself a good deal in his Library. And I have been taken up pretty much, I hope, as I ought to be, in Thankfulness, Prayer, and Meditation in my newly presented Closet: And I hope God will be pleas’d to give a Blessing to me; for I have the Pleasure to think I am not puffed up with this great Alteration; and yet am not wanting to look upon all these Favours and Blessings in the Light wherein I ought to receive them, both at the Hands of God, and my dear Benefactor.</p>
<p class="indent">We din’d together with great Pleasure, and I had in every Word and Action, all the Instances of Kindness and Affection that the most indulg’d Heart could wish. He said he would return to his Closet again; and at Five o’Clock would come and take a Walk with me in the Garden, and so retir’d as soon as he had din’d; and I went up to mine.</p>
<p class="indent">About Six he was pleas’d to come up to me, and said, Now, my <a id="page_470"></a>Dear, I will attend you for a little Walk in the Garden; and I gave him my Hand with great Pleasure. This Garden is much better cultivated than the <em class="calibre6">Lincolnshire</em> one; but that is larger; and has nobler Walks in it; and yet here is a pretty Canal in this, and a Fountain, and Cascade. We had a deal of sweet Conversation as we walk’d; and, after we had taken a Turn round, I bent towards the little Garden, and when I came near the Summer-house, took the Opportunity to slip from him, and just whipt up the Steps of this once frightful Place, and kneeled down, and said, I bless thee, O God, for my Escapes, and for thy Mercies! O let me always possess a grateful and humble Heart! And I whipt down again, and join’d him; and he hardly missed me. Several of the neighbouring Gentry sent their Compliments to him on his Return, but not a Word about his Marriage, particularly ’Squire <em class="calibre6">Arthur</em>, ’Squire <em class="calibre6">Towers</em>, ’Squire <em class="calibre6">Brooks</em>, and ’Squire <em class="calibre6">Martin</em> of the Grove.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">MONDAY</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">I Had a good deal of Employment in chusing Patterns for my new Cloaths. He thought nothing too good; but I thought every thing I saw was; and he was so kind, to pick out Six of the richest, for me to chuse three Suits out of, saying, we would furnish ourselves with more in Town, when we went thither. One was a white flower’d with Gold most richly; and he was pleased to say, that as I was a Bride, I should make my Appearance in that the following <em class="calibre6">Sunday</em>. And so we shall have in two or three Days, from several Places, nothing but Mantua-makers and Taylors at Work. Bless me! what a chargeable, and what a worthless Hussy I am, to the dear Gentleman!—But his Fortune and Station require a great deal of it; and his Value for me, will not let him do less than if he had marry’d a Fortune equal to his own; and then, as he says, it would be a Reflection upon him if he did.—And so I doubt it will be as it is: For, either way, the World will have something to say. He made me also chuse some very fine Laces, and Linen; and has sent a Message on purpose, with his Orders, to hasten all down; what can be done in Town, as the Millenary Matters, <em class="calibre6">&amp;c</em>. to be completed there, and sent by particular Messengers, as done. All to be here, and finished by <em class="calibre6">Saturday</em> Afternoon without fail.</p>
<p class="indent">I send away <em class="calibre6">John</em> this Morning, with some more of my Papers to <a id="page_471"></a>you, and with the few he will give you, separate. My Desire is, that you will send me all the Papers you have done with, that I may keep my Word with Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers;</em> to beg the Continuance of your Prayers and Blessings; to hope you will give me your Answer about my dear Benefactor’s Proposal of the <em class="calibre6">Kentish</em> Farm; to beg you to buy two Suits of Cloaths, each, of the finest Cloth for you, my dear Father, and of a creditable Silk for my dear Mother; and good Linen, and every thing answerable; and that you will, as my dearest Sir bid me say, let us see you here, as soon as possible, and he will have his Chariot come for you, when you tell <em class="calibre6">John</em> the Day. Oh! how I long to see you both, my dear good Parents, and to share with you my Felicities!</p>
<p class="indent">You will have, I am sure, the Goodness to go to all your Creditors, which are chiefly those of my poor unhappy Brothers, and get an Account of all you are bound for; and every one shall be paid to the utmost Farthing, and Interest besides, tho’ some of them have been very cruel and unrelenting.—But they are all intitled to their own, and shall be thankfully paid.</p>
<p class="indent">Now I think of it, <em class="calibre6">John</em> shall take my Papers down to this Place; that you may have something to amuse you of your dear Child’s, instead of those you part with; and I will continue writing till I am settled, and you are determin’d; and then I shall apply myself to the Duties of the Family, in order to become as useful to my dear Benefactor, as my small Abilities will let me.</p>
<p class="indent">If you think a Couple of Guineas will be of Use to Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Mumford</em>, who I doubt has not much aforehand, pray give them to her, from me, (and I will return them to you) as for a Pair of Gloves on my Nuptials: And look thro’ your poor Acquaintance, and Neighbours, and let me have a List of such honest, industrious Poor, as may be true Objects of Charity; and have no other Assistance; particularly such as are blind, lame, or sickly, with their particular Cases; and also, such poor Families and Housekeepers as are reduced by Misfortunes, as ours was, and where a great Number of Children may keep them from rising to a State of tolerable Comfort: And I will chuse as well as I can; for I long to be making a Beginning, with the kind Quarterly Benevolence my dear good Benefactor has bestowed on me for such good Purposes.</p>
<p class="indent">I am resolv’d to keep Account of all these Matters, and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em> has already furnish’d me with a Vellum-book of all white Paper; <a id="page_472"></a>some Sides of which I hope soon to fill, with the Names of proper Objects: And tho’ my dear Master has given me all this without Account, yet shall he see, (but nobody else) how I lay it out, from Quarter to Quarter; and I will, if any be left, carry it on, like an Accomptant, to the next Quarter, and strike a Ballance four times a Year, and a general Ballance at every Year’s End.—And I have written in it, <em class="calibre6">Humble</em> R<small class="calibre2">ETURNS</small> <em class="calibre6">for</em> D<small class="calibre2">IVINE</small> M<small class="calibre2">ERCIES</small>; and lock it up safe in my newly presented Cabinet.</p>
<p class="indent">I intend to let Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> see no further of my Papers, than to her own angry Letter to her Brother; for I would not have her see my Reflections upon it; and she’ll know, down to that Place, all that’s necessary for her Curiosity, as to my Sufferings, and the Stratagems used against me, and the honest Part God enabled me to act: And I hope, when she sees them all, she will be quite reconcil’d; for she will see it is all God Almighty’s Doings; and that a Gentleman of his Parts and Knowledge was not to be drawn in by such a poor young Body as me. I will detain <em class="calibre6">John</em> no longer. He will tell you to read this last Part first, and while he stays. And so with my humble Duty to you both, and my dear Sir’s kind Remembrance, I rest,</p>
<p class="right"><em class="calibre6">Your ever dutiful and gratefully happy Daughter</em>.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">WEDNESDAY Evening</em>.</h4>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre6">Honoured Father and Mother</em>,</p>
<p class="noindent">I Will now proceed with my Journal.</p>
<p class="indent">On <em class="calibre6">Tuesday</em> Morning, my dear Sir rode out, attended by <em class="calibre6">Abraham;</em> and he brought with him to Dinner Mr. <em class="calibre6">Martin</em> of the Grove, and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Arthur</em>, and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Brooks</em>, and one Mr. <em class="calibre6">Chambers;</em> and he stept up to me, and said he had rode out too far to return to Breakfast; but he had brought with him some of his old Acquaintance, to dine with me. Are you sorry for it, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said he? I remembered his Lessons, and said, No, sure, Sir; I can’t be angry at any thing you are pleas’d to do. Said he, you know Mr. <em class="calibre6">Martin</em>’s Character, and have severely censur’d him in one of your Letters, as one of my Brother Rakes, and for his three Lyings-in.—</p>
<p class="indent">He then gave me the following Account, how he came to bring them. Said he, ‘I met them all at Mr. <em class="calibre6">Arthur’s</em>, and his Lady asked me, if I was really marry’d? I said, Yes, really. And to who, said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Martin?</em> Why, reply’d I, bluntly, to my Mother’s Waiting-maid. <a id="page_473"></a>They could not tell what to say to me, hereupon, and look’d one upon another. And I saw I had spoil’d a Jest, from each. Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Arthur</em> said, You have indeed, Sir, a charming Creature as ever I saw, and she has mighty good Luck. Ay, said I; and so have I. But I shall say the less, because a Man never did any thing of this Nature, that he did not think he ought, if it were but in Policy, to make the best of it. Nay, said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Arthur</em>, if you have sinn’d, it is with your Eyes open: For you know the World as well as any Gentleman of your Years in it.</p>
<p class="indent">‘Why, really, Gentlemen, said I, I should be glad to please all my Friends; but I can’t expect, till they know my Motives and Inducements, that it will be so immediately. But I do assure you, I am exceedingly pleased myself; and, that, you know, is most to the Purpose.</p>
<p class="indent">‘Said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Brooks</em>, I have heard my Wife praise your Spouse that is, so much, for Beauty and Shape, that I wanted to see her of all Things. Why, reply’d I, if you’ll all go and take a Dinner with me, you shall see her with all my Heart. And, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Arthur</em>, will you bear us Company? No, indeed, Sir, said she. What, I’ll warrant, my <em class="calibre6">Wife</em> will not be able to reconcile you to my <em class="calibre6">Mother’s Waiting-maid;</em> is not that it? Tell Truth, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Arthur</em>. Nay, said she, I shan’t be backward to pay your Spouse a Visit, in Company of the neighbouring Ladies; but for one single Woman to go, on such a sudden Motion too, with so many Gentlemen, is not right. But that need not hinder you, Gentlemen. So, said he, the rest sent, that they should not dine at home; and they, and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Chambers</em>, a Gentleman lately settled in these Parts, one and all came with me: And so, my Dear, concluded he, when you make your Appearance next <em class="calibre6">Sunday</em>, you’re sure of a Party in your Favour; for all that see you must esteem you.’</p>
<p class="indent">He went to them; and when I came down to Dinner, he was pleased to take me by the Hand, at my Entrance into the Parlour, and said, My dear Love, I have brought some of my good Neighbours to take a Dinner with you. I said, You are very good, Sir!—My Dear, this Gentleman is Mr. <em class="calibre6">Chambers;</em> and so he presented every one, to me; and they saluted me, and wish’d us both Joy.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. <em class="calibre6">Brooks</em> said, I, for my Part, wish you Joy most heartily. My Wife told me a good deal of the Beauties of your Person; but I did not think we had such a Flower in our County. Sir, said I, your Lady is very partial to me; and you are so polite a Gentleman, that you will not contradict your good Lady.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_474"></a>I’ll assure you, Madam, return’d he, you have not hit the Matter at all; for we contradict one another twice or thrice a Day. But the Devil’s in’t if we are not agreed in so clear a Case.</p>
<p class="indent">Said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Martin</em>, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Brooks</em> says very true, Madam, in both respects (meaning his Wife’s and his own Contradiction to one another, as well as in my Favour); for, added he, they have been marry’d some Years.</p>
<p class="indent">As I had not the best Opinion of this Gentleman, nor his Jest, I said, I am almost sorry, Sir, for the Gentleman’s Jest upon himself and his Lady; but I think it should have reliev’d him from a greater Jest, your pleasant Confirmation of it.—But still, the Reason you give that it may be so, I hope, is the Reason that may be given that it is not so,—to wit, That they have been married some Years.</p>
<p class="indent">Said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Arthur</em>, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Martin</em>, I think the Lady has very handsomely reprov’d you. I think so too, said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Chambers;</em> and it was but a very indifferent Compliment to a Bride. Said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Martin</em>, Compliment or not, Gentlemen, I have never seen a Matrimony of any time standing, that it was not so, little or much. But I dare say, it will never be so here.</p>
<p class="indent">To be sure, Sir, said I, if it was, I must be the ungratefullest Person in the World, because I am the most obliged Person in it. That Notion, said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Arthur</em>, is so excellent, that it gives a moral Certainty, that it never can.</p>
<p class="indent">Sir, said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Brooks</em>, to my dear Sir, softly, You have a most accomplished Lady, I do assure you, as well in her Behaviour and Wit, as in her Person, call her what you please. Why, my dear Friend, said my Master, I must tell you, That her Person made me her Lover; but her Mind made her my Wife.</p>
<p class="indent">The first Course coming in, my dear Sir led me himself to my Place; and set Mr. <em class="calibre6">Chambers</em>, as the greatest Stranger, at my Right-hand, and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Brooks</em> at my Left; and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Arthur</em> was pleased to observe, much to my Advantage, on the Ease and Freedom with which I behav’d myself, and helped them; and said, He would bring his Lady to be a Witness, and a Learner both, of my Manner. I said, I should be proud of any Honour Lady <em class="calibre6">Arthur</em> would vouchsafe to do me; and if I once could promise myself the Opportunity of his good Lady’s Example, and those of the other Gentlemen present, I should have the greater Opinion of my Worthiness to sit in the Place I fill’d, at present, with much Insufficiency.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_475"></a>Mr. <em class="calibre6">Arthur</em> drank to my Health and Happiness, and said, my Wife told your Spouse, Madam, You had very good Luck in such a Husband; but I now see who has the best of it. Said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Brooks</em>, Come, come, let’s make no Compliments; for the plain Truth of the Matter is, our good Neighbour’s Generosity and Judgment have met with so equal a Match, in his Lady’s Beauty and Merit, that I know not which has the best Luck. But may you be both long happy together, say I! And so he drank a Glass of Wine.</p>
<p class="indent">My dear Sir, who always takes Delight to have me praised, seemed much pleased with our Conversation; and he said the kindest, tenderest, and most respectful Things in the World to me. Insomuch, that the rough Mr. <em class="calibre6">Martin</em> said, Did you ever think our good Friend here, who used to ridicule Matrimony so much, would have made so complaisant a Husband? How long do you intend, Sir, that this shall hold? As long as my good Girl deserves it, said he, and that I hope will be for ever. But, continued he, you need not wonder I have changed my Mind as to Wedlock; for I never expected to meet with one whose Behaviour and Sweetness of Temper was so well adapted to make me happy.</p>
<p class="indent">After Dinner, and having drank good Healths to each of their Ladies, I withdrew; and they sat and drank two Bottles of Claret apiece, and were very merry; and went away, full of my Praises, and vowing to bring their Ladies to see me.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre6">John</em> having brought me your kind Letter, my dear Father, I told my good Master, after his Friends were gone, how gratefully you received his generous Intentions as to the <em class="calibre6">Kentish</em> Farm, and promised your best Endeavours to serve him in that Estate; and that you hoped your Industry and Care would be so well employ’d in it, that you should be very little troublesome to him as to the liberal Manner in which he had intended to add to a Provision, that of itself exceeded all your Wishes. He was very well pleased with your chearful Acceptance of it.</p>
<p class="indent">I am glad your Engagements in the World lie in so small a Compass: As soon as you have gotten an Account of them exactly, you will be pleased to send it me, with the List of the poor Folks you are so kind to promise to procure me.</p>
<p class="indent">I think, as my dear Master is so generous, you should think nothing that is plain too good. Pray, don’t be afraid of laying out upon <a id="page_476"></a>yourselves. My dear Sir intends that you shall not, when you come to us, return to your old Abode, but stay with us, till you set out for <em class="calibre6">Kent;</em> and so you must dispose of yourselves accordingly. And, I hope, my dear Father, you have quite left off all Slavish Business. As Farmer <em class="calibre6">Jones</em> has been kind to you, as I have heard you say, pray, when you take Leave of them, present them with three Guineas worth of good Books, such as a Family-Bible, a Common-Prayer, a Whole Duty of Man,<a id="exp-note_106"></a><a href="part0021_split_106.html#exp-note-106" class="nounder">*</a> or any other you think will be acceptable; for they live a great way from Church; and in Winter, the Ways from their Farm thither are impassable.</p>
<p class="indent">He has brought me my Papers safe: And I will send them to Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> the first Opportunity, down to the Place I mentioned in my last.</p>
<p class="indent">My dear Sir, just now tells me, that he will carry me in the Morning a little Airing, about ten Miles off, in his Chariot and Four, to Breakfast at a Farm-house, noted for a fine Dairy, and where, now-and-then, the neighbouring Gentry of both Sexes resort, for that Purpose. And he will send <em class="calibre6">Abraham</em> on Horse-back, before us; to let the good Folks know it.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">THURSDAY</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">WE set out at about half an Hour after Six, accordingly, and driving pretty smartly, got at this truly neat House at half an Hour after Eight, and found <em class="calibre6">Abraham</em> there; and I was much pleas’d with the Neatness of the good Woman, and Daughter, and Maid; and he was so good as to say he would now-and-then take a Turn with me to the same Place, and on the same Occasion, as I seem’d to like it; for that it would be a pretty Exercise, and procure us Appetites to our Breakfasts, as well as our Return would to our Dinners. But I find this was not (tho’ a very good Reason) the only one for which he gave me this agreeable Airing; as I shall acquaint you.</p>
<p class="indent">We were prettily receiv’d and entertain’d here, and an Elegance ran through every thing, Persons as well as Furniture, yet all plain. And my Master said to the good Housewife, Do your young Boarding-school Ladies still at times continue their Visits to you, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Dobson?</em> Yes, Sir, said she, I expect three or four of them every Minute.</p>
<p class="indent">There is, my Dear, said he, within three Miles of this Farm, a very <a id="page_477"></a>good Boarding-school for Ladies: The Governess of it keeps a Chaise and Pair, which is to be made a double Chaise at Pleasure; and in Summer-time, when the Misses perform their Tasks to Satisfaction, she favours them with an Airing to this Place, three or four at a Time; and after they have breakfasted, they are carried back: And this serves both for a Reward, and for Exercise; and the Misses who have this Favour are not a little proud of it; and it brings them forward in their respective Tasks.</p>
<p class="indent">A very good Method, Sir, said I. And just as we were talking, the Chaise came in with four Misses, all pretty much of a Size, and a Maid-servant to attend them. They were shewn another little neat Apartment, that went thro’ ours, and made their Honours very prettily, as they passed by us. I went into the Room to them, and asked them Questions about their Work, and their Lessons; and what they had done to deserve such a fine Airing and Breakfasting; and they all answer’d me very prettily. And pray, little Ladies, said I, what may I call your Names? One was called Miss <em class="calibre6">Burdoff</em>, one Miss <em class="calibre6">Nugent</em>, one Miss <em class="calibre6">Booth</em>, and the fourth Miss <em class="calibre6">Goodwin</em>. I don’t know which, said I, is the prettiest; but you are all best, my little Dears; and you have a very good Governess to indulge you with such a fine Airing, and such delicate Cream, and Bread and Butter. I hope you think so too.</p>
<p class="indent">My Master came in, and I had no Mistrust in the World; and he kissed each of them; but look’d more wistfully on Miss <em class="calibre6">Goodwin</em>, than any of the others; but I thought nothing just then: Had she been called Miss <em class="calibre6">Godfrey</em>, I had hit upon it in a trice.</p>
<p class="indent">When we went from them, he said, Which do you think the prettiest of those Misses? Really, Sir, reply’d I, it is hard to say; Miss <em class="calibre6">Booth</em> is a pretty brown Girl, and has a fine Eye; Miss <em class="calibre6">Burdoff</em> has a great deal of Sweetness in her Countenance, but not so regularly featur’d. Miss <em class="calibre6">Nugent</em> is very fair; And Miss <em class="calibre6">Goodwin</em> has a fine black Eye, and is besides, I think, the genteelest shap’d Child; but they are all pretty.</p>
<p class="indent">The Maid led them into the Garden, to shew them the Bee-hives; and Miss <em class="calibre6">Goodwin</em> made a particular fine Curchee to my Master; and I said, I believe Miss knows you, Sir; and taking her by the Hand, I said, Do you know this Gentleman, my pretty Dear?—Yes, Madam, said she, It is my own dear Uncle. I clasp’d her in my Arms, O why did you not tell me, Sir, said I, that you had a Niece among these little Ladies? And I kissed her, and away she tript, after the others.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_478"></a>But pray, Sir, said I; How can this be?—You have no Sister nor Brother, but Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers!</em>—How can this be?</p>
<p class="indent">He smiled; and then I said, O my dear Sir, tell me now of a Truth, Does not this pretty Miss stand in a nearer Relation to you, than as a Niece?—I know she does! I know she does! And I embrac’d him as he stood.</p>
<p class="indent">’Tis even so, my Dear, reply’d he; and you remember my Sister’s good-natur’d Hint of Miss <em class="calibre6">Sally Godfrey!</em> I do well, Sir! answer’d I. But this is Miss <em class="calibre6">Goodwin</em>. Her Mother chose that for her, said he, because she should not be called by her own.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, said I, excuse me, Sir, I must go and have a little Prattle with her. I’ll send for her in again, reply’d he; and in she came, in a Moment. I took her in my Arms, and said, O my charming Dear! will you love me?—Will you let me be your Aunt? Yes, Madam, answer’d she, with all my Heart! And I will love <em class="calibre6">you</em> dearly! But I mustn’t love my Uncle! Why so? said he. Because, reply’d she, you would not speak to me at first!—And because you would not let me call you, Uncle; (for it seems she was bid not, that I might not guess at her presently) and yet, said the pretty Dear, I had not seen you a great while, so I hadn’t!</p>
<p class="indent">Well, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said he, now can you allow me to love this little Innocent? Allow you, Sir! reply’d I; you would be very barbarous if you did not; and I should be more so, if I did not further it all I could, and love the little Lamb myself, for your sake, and for her own sake; and in Compassion to her poor dear Mother, tho’ unknown to me. And Tears stood in my Eyes.</p>
<p class="indent">Said he, Why, my Love, are your Words so kind, and your Countenance so sad?—I drew to the Window, from the Child, and said, Sad it is not, Sir; but I have a strange Grief and Pleasure mingled at once in my Breast, on this Occasion: It is indeed a twofold Grief, and a twofold Pleasure. As how, my Dear? said he.—Why, Sir, said I, I cannot help being grieved for the poor Mother of this sweet Babe, to think, if she be living, that she must call her chiefest Delight her Shame; if she be no more, that she must have sad Remorses on her poor Mind, when she came to leave the World, and her little Babe: And, in the second Place, I grieve, that it must be thought a Kindness to the dear little Soul, not to let her know how near the dearest Relation she has in the World is to her!—Forgive me, dear Sir, I say not this to reproach you, in the least. Indeed, I don’t. And I have a <a id="page_479"></a>twofold Cause of Joy; first, That I have had the Grace to escape the like Unhappiness with this poor Gentlewoman; and next, That this Discovery has given me an Opportunity to shew the Sincerity of my grateful Affection for you, Sir, in the Love I will always express to this dear Child!</p>
<p class="indent">And then I stept to her again, and kissed her; and said, Join with me, my pretty Love, to beg your dear Uncle to let you come home, and live with your new Aunt! Indeed, my little Precious, I’ll love you dearly!</p>
<p class="indent">Will you, Sir, said the little Charmer, will you let me go and live with my Aunt?</p>
<p class="indent">You are very good, my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, said he.—And I have not once been deceived in the Hopes my fond Heart had entertained of your Prudence.—But will you, Sir, said I, will you grant me this Favour!—I shall most sincerely love the little Charmer; and all I am capable of doing for her, both by Example and Affection, shall most cordially be done.—My dearest Sir, added I, oblige me in this thing! I think already my Heart is set upon it!—What a sweet Employment and Companionship shall I have!</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll talk of this some other Time, reply’d he; but I must, in Prudence, put some Bounds to your amiable Generosity. I had always intended to surprize you into this Discovery; but my Sister led the Way to it, out of a Poorness in her Spite, that I could not brook; and tho’ you have pleased me beyond Expression, in your Behaviour on this Occasion; yet I can’t say, that you have gone much beyond my Expectations, for I have such an high Opinion of you, that I think nothing could have shaken it, but a contrary Conduct to this you have express’d on so tender a Circumstance.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, Sir, said the dear little Miss, then you won’t let me go home with my Aunt, will you? I’m sure she’ll love me! When you break up next, my Dear, said he, if you’re a good Girl, you shall make your new Aunt a Visit. She made a low Curchee, Thank you, Sir, said she. Yes, my Dear, said I, and I’ll get you some fine things against the Time. I’d have brought you some now, had I known I should have seen my pretty Love! Thank you, Madam, return’d she.</p>
<p class="indent">How old, Sir, said I, is Miss? Between Six and Seven, answer’d he. Was she ever, Sir, said I, at your House? My Sister, reply’d he, carry’d her there once, as a little Relation of her Lord’s. I remember, <a id="page_480"></a>Sir, said I, a little Miss; and Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em> and I took her to be a Relation of Lord <em class="calibre6">Davers’s</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">My Sister, said he, knew the whole Secret from the Beginning; and it made her a great Merit with me, that she kept it from the Knowledge of my Father, who was then living, and of my Mother, to her Dying-day; tho’ she descended so low, in her Rage, to hint the Matter to you.</p>
<p class="indent">The little Misses took their Leaves soon after; and I know not how, but I am strangely affected with this dear Child. I wish he would be so good as to let me have her home. It would be a great Pleasure to have such a fine Opportunity, oblig’d as I am, to shew my Love for himself, in my Fondness for this dear Miss.</p>
<p class="indent">As we came home together in the Chariot, he gave me the following Particulars of this Affair, additional to what he had before mention’d.</p>
<p class="indent">That this Lady was of a good Family, and the Flower of it: But that her Mother was a Person of great Art and Address, and not altogether so nice in the Particular between himself and Miss, as she ought to have been. That, particularly, when she had Reason to find him unsettled and wild, and her Daughter in more Danger from him, than he was from her; yet she encouraged their Privacies; and even, at last, when she had Reason to apprehend, from their being surpriz’d together, in a way not so creditable to the Lady, that she was far from forbidding their private Meetings; on the contrary, that on a certain Time, she had set one, that had formerly been her Footman, and a Half-pay Officer, her Relation, to watch an Opportunity, and to frighten him into a Marriage with the Lady. That accordingly, when they had surpriz’d him in her Chamber, just as he had been let in, they drew their Swords upon him, and threaten’d instantly to kill him, if he did not promise Marriage on the Spot; and that they had a Parson ready below Stairs, as he found afterwards. That then he suspected, from some strong Circumstances, that Miss was in the Plot; which so enraged him, with their Menaces together, that he drew, and stood upon his Defence, and was so much in Earnest, that the Man he push’d into the Arm, and disabled; and pressing pretty forward upon the other, as he retreated, he rushed in upon him, near the Top of the Stairs, and push’d him down one Pair, and he was much hurt with the Fall:—Not but that, he said, he might have paid for his Rashness; but that the Business of <a id="page_481"></a>his Antagonists was rather to frighten than kill him. That, upon this, in the Sight of the old Lady, the Parson she had provided, and her other Daughters, he went out of their House, with bitter Execrations against them all.</p>
<p class="indent">That after this, designing to break off all Correspondence with the whole Family, and Miss too, she found means to engage him to give her a Meeting at <em class="calibre6">Woodstock</em>, in order to clear herself. That, poor Lady! she there was obliged, naughty Creature as he was! to make herself quite guilty of a worse Fault, in order to clear herself of a lighter. That they afterwards met at <em class="calibre6">Godstow</em> often, at <em class="calibre6">Woodstock</em>, and every neighbouring Place to <em class="calibre6">Oxford;</em> where he was then studying, as it prov’d, guilty Lessons, instead of improving ones; till, at last, the Effect of their frequent Interviews grew too obvious to be concealed. That the young Lady then, when she was not fit to be seen, for the Credit of the Family, was confin’d, and all manner of Means were used, to induce him to marry her. That, finding nothing would do, they at last resolved to complain to his Father and Mother. But that he made his Sister acquainted with the Matter, who then happen’d to be at home, and, by her Management and Spirit, their Intentions of that sort, were frustrated; and seeing no Hopes, they agreed to Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>’s Proposals, and sent poor Miss down to <em class="calibre6">Marlborough<a id="exp-note_107"></a><a href="part0021_split_107.html#exp-note-107" class="nounder">*</a></em> where, at her Expence, which he answer’d to her again, she was provided for, and privately lay-in. That Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> took upon herself the Care of the Little-one, till it came to be fit to be put to the Boarding-school, where it now is; and that he had settled upon the dear little Miss such a Sum of Money, as the Interest of it would handsomely provide for her; and the Principal would be a tolerable Fortune, fit for a Gentlewoman, when she came to be marriageable. And this, my Dear, said he, is the Story in brief. And I do assure you, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, added he, I am far from making a Boast of, or taking a Pride in, this Affair: But since it has happen’d, I can’t say, but I wish the poor Child to live, and be happy; and I must endeavour to make her so.</p>
<p class="indent">Sir, said I, to be sure you should; and I shall take a very great Pride to contribute to the dear little Soul’s Felicity, if you will permit me to have her home.—But, added I, does not Miss know any thing who are her Father and Mother?—I wanted him to say, if the poor Lady was living or dead.—No, answer’d he. Her Governess has been told, by my Sister, That she is the Daughter of a Gentleman and his Lady, <a id="page_482"></a>who are related, at a Distance, to Lord <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>, and now live in <em class="calibre6">Jamaica;</em> and she calls me Uncle, only because I am the Brother to Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>, whom she calls Aunt, and who is very fond of her; as is also my Lord, who knows the whole Matter; and they have her, at all her little School Recesses, at their House, and are very kind to her.</p>
<p class="indent">I believe, added he, the Truth of the Matter is very little known or suspected; for as her Mother <em class="calibre6">is</em> of no mean Family, her Friends endeavour to keep it secret, as much as I; and Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>, till her Wrath boil’d over, t’other Day, has manag’d the Matter very dexterously and kindly.</p>
<p class="indent">The Words, Mother <em class="calibre6">is</em> of no mean Family, gave me not to doubt the poor Lady was living. And I said, But how, Sir, can the dear Miss’s poor Mother be content to deny herself the Enjoyment of so sweet a Child?—Ay, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, reply’d he, now <em class="calibre6">you</em> come in; I see you want to know what’s become of the poor Mother!—’Tis natural enough you should; but I was willing to see how the little Suspence would operate upon you.—Dear Sir, said I—Nay, reply’d he, ’tis very natural, my Dear! I think you have had a great deal of Patience, and are come at this Question so fairly, that you deserve to be answer’d.</p>
<p class="indent">You must know then, there is some Foundation for saying, That her Mother, at least, lives in <em class="calibre6">Jamaica;</em> for there she does live, and very happily too. For you must know, that she suffer’d so much in Childbed, that nobody expected her Life; and this, when she was up, made such an Impression upon her, that she dreaded nothing so much as the Thoughts of returning to her former Fault; and to say the Truth, I had intended to make her a Visit as soon as her Month was well up. And so, unknown to me, she engaged herself to go to <em class="calibre6">Jamaica</em>, with two young Ladies, who were born there; but were returning to their Friends, after they had been four Years in <em class="calibre6">England</em> for their Education; and recommending to me, by a very moving Letter, her little Baby, and that I would not suffer it to be called by her Name, but <em class="calibre6">Goodwin</em>, that her Shame might be the less known, for hers and her Family’s sake; she got her Friends to assign her Five hundred Pounds, in full of all her Demands upon her Family, and went up to <em class="calibre6">London</em>, and imbarked, with her Companions, at <em class="calibre6">Graves-end</em>, and so sailed to <em class="calibre6">Jamaica;</em> where she is since well and happily marry’d; passing, to her Husband, for a young Widow, with one Daughter, which her first Husband’s Friends take care of, and provide <a id="page_483"></a>for. And so, you see, <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, that in the whole Story on both sides, the Truth is as much preserv’d as possible.</p>
<p class="indent">Poor Lady! said I; how her Story moves me!—I am glad she is so happy at last! And, my Dear, said he, Are you not glad she is so far off too?—As to that, Sir, said I, I cannot be sorry, to be sure, as she is so happy; which she could not have been here. For, Sir, I doubt, you would have proceeded with your Temptations, if she had not gone; and it shew’d she was much in Earnest to be good, that she could leave her native Country, leave all her Relations, leave you that she so well lov’d, leave her dear Baby, and try a new Fortune, in a new World, among quite Strangers, and hazard the Seas; and all to preserve herself from further Guiltiness!—Indeed, indeed, Sir, said I, I bleed for what her Distresses must be in this Life: I am grieved for her poor Mind’s Remorse, thro’ her Childbed Terrors, which could have so great and so worthy an Effect upon her afterwards; and I honour her Resolution; and should rank such a returning dear Lady in the Class of those who are most virtuous, and doubt not God Almighty’s Mercies to her; and that her present Happiness is the Result of his gracious Providence, blessing her Penitence and Reformation.—But, Sir, said I, Did you not once see the poor Lady after her Lying-in?</p>
<p class="indent">I did not believe her so much in Earnest, answer’d he; and I went down to <em class="calibre6">Marlborough</em>, and heard she was gone from thence to <em class="calibre6">Calne</em>. I went to <em class="calibre6">Calne,<a id="exp-note_108"></a><a href="part0021_split_108.html#exp-note-108" class="nounder">*</a></em> and heard she was gone to <em class="calibre6">Reading</em>, to a Relation’s there. Thither I went, and heard she was gone to <em class="calibre6">Oxford</em>. I follow’d; and there she was; but I could not come at her Speech.</p>
<p class="indent">She at last received a Letter from me, begging a Meeting with her; for I found her Departure with the Ladies was resolved on; and that she was with her Friends only to take Leave of them, and receive her agreed-on Portion: And she appointed the <em class="calibre6">Saturday</em> following, and that was <em class="calibre6">Wednesday</em>, to give me a Meeting at the old Place, at <em class="calibre6">Woodstock</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Then, added he, I thought I was sure of her, and doubted not I should spoil her intended Voyage. I set out on <em class="calibre6">Thursday</em> to <em class="calibre6">Gloucester</em>, on a Party of Pleasure; and on <em class="calibre6">Saturday</em> I went to the Place appointed, at <em class="calibre6">Woodstock;</em> but when I came there, I found a Letter instead of my Lady; and when I open’d it, it was to beg my Pardon for deceiving me. Expressing her Concern for her past Fault; her Affection to me; and the Apprehension she had, that she should be <a id="page_484"></a>unable to keep her good Resolves if she met me: That she had set out the <em class="calibre6">Thursday</em> for her Embarkation; for that she fear’d nothing else could save her; and had appointed this Meeting on <em class="calibre6">Saturday</em>, at the Place of her former Guilt, that I might be suitably impress’d upon the Occasion, and pity and allow for her; and that she might get three or four Days start of me, and be quite out of my Reach. She recommended again, as upon the Spot where the poor Little-one ow’d its Being, my Tenderness to it, for her sake: and that was all she had to request of me, she said; but would not forget to pray for me in all her own Dangers, and in every Difficulty she was going to encounter.</p>
<p class="indent">I wept at this moving Tale: And did not this impress you much, my dear Sir, said I? Surely, such an affecting Lesson as this, on the very guilty Spot too, (I admire the dear Lady’s pious Contrivance!) must have had a great Effect upon you. One would have thought, Sir, it was enough to reclaim you for ever. All your naughty Purposes, I make no Doubt, were quite chang’d. Why, my Dear, said he, I was much mov’d, you may be sure, when I came to reflect: But, at first, I was so assur’d of being a successful Tempter, and spoiling her Voyage, that I was vexed, and much out of Humour; but when I came to reflect, as I said, I was quite overcome with this Instance of her Prudence, her Penitence, and her Resolution; and more admir’d her than I had ever done. Yet I could not bear she should so escape me neither; so much overcome me, as it were, in an heroical Bravery; and I hasten’d away, and got a Bill of Credit of Lord <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>, upon his Banker in <em class="calibre6">London</em>, for Five hundred Pounds, and set out for that Place; having called at <em class="calibre6">Oxford</em>, and got what Light I could, as to where I might hear of her there.</p>
<p class="indent">When I arriv’d in Town, which was not till <em class="calibre6">Monday</em> Morning, I went to a Place called <em class="calibre6">Crosby-square<a id="exp-note_109"></a><a href="part0021_split_109.html#exp-note-109" class="nounder">*</a></em> where the Friends of the two Ladies liv’d. She had set out, in the Flying-coach, on <em class="calibre6">Tuesday;</em> got to the two Ladies that very Night; and, on <em class="calibre6">Saturday</em>, had set out, with them, for <em class="calibre6">Gravesend<a id="exp-note_110"></a><a href="part0021_split_110.html#exp-note-110" class="nounder">*</a></em> much about the Time I was expecting her at <em class="calibre6">Woodstock</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">You may suppose, that I was much affected, my Dear, with this. However, I got my Bill of Credit converted into Money; and I set out, with my Servant, on <em class="calibre6">Monday</em> Afternoon, and reached <em class="calibre6">Gravesend</em> that Night; and there I understood that she and the two Ladies had gone on Board from the very Inn I put up at, in the Morning; and <a id="page_485"></a>the Ship waited only for the Wind, which then was turning about in its Favour.</p>
<p class="indent">I got a Boat directly, and put on Board the Ship, and asked for Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Godfrey</em>. But judge you, my dear <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, her Surprize and Confusion when she saw me. She had like to have fainted away. I offer’d any Money to put off the Sailing till next Day, but it would not be comply’d with; and fain would I have got her on Shore, and promised to attend her, if she would go over Land, to any Part of <em class="calibre6">England</em> the Ship would touch at. But she was immoveable.</p>
<p class="indent">Every one concluded me her humble Servant; and were touched at the moving Interview; the young Ladies, and their Female Attendants especially. With great Difficulty, upon my solemn Assurances of Honour, she trusted herself with me in one of the Cabins; and there I try’d, what I could, to prevail upon her to quit her Purpose: But all in vain: She said, I had made her quite unhappy by this Interview! She had Difficulties enough upon her Mind before; but now I had imbitter’d all her Voyage, and given her the deepest Distress.</p>
<p class="indent">I could prevail upon her, but for one Favour, and that with the greatest Reluctance; which was, to accept of the Five hundred Pounds, as a Present from me; and she promised, at my earnest Desire, to draw upon me for a greater Sum, as a Person that had her Effects in my Hands, when she arriv’d, if she should find it convenient for her. In short, this was all the Favour I could procure; for she would not promise so much as to correspond with me; and was determin’d on going; and, I believe, if I would have marry’d her, which yet I had not in my Head, she would not have been diverted from her Purpose.</p>
<p class="indent">But how, Sir, said I, did you part? I would have sailed with her, answer’d he, and been landed at the first Port in <em class="calibre6">England</em>, or <em class="calibre6">Ireland</em>, I cared not which, they should put in at. But she was too full of Apprehensions to admit it; and the rough Fellow of a Master, Captain they call’d him, (but, in my Mind, I could have thrown him overboard) would not stay a Moment, the Wind and Tide being quite fair, and was very urgent with me to go ashore, or to go the Voyage; and being impetuous in my Temper, <em class="calibre6">spoilt, you know, my Dear, by my Mother</em>, and not used to Controul, I thought it very strange that Wind and Tide, or any thing else, should be preferr’d to me, and my Money: But so it was, I was forced to go, and so took <a id="page_486"></a>Leave of the Ladies and the other Passengers; wish’d them a good Voyage; gave Five Guineas among the Ship’s Crew, to be good to the Ladies; and took such a Leave as you may better imagine, than I express. She recommended, once more, to me, the dear Guest, as she called her, the Ladies being present, and thanked me for all these Instances of my Regard, which, she said, would leave a strong Impression on her Mind; and, at parting, she threw her Arms about my Neck, and we took such a Leave, as affected every one present, Men, as well as Ladies.</p>
<p class="indent">So, with a truly heavy Heart, I went down the Ship’s Side to my Boat; and stood up in it, looking at her, as long as I could see her, and she at me, with her Handkerchief at her Eyes; and then I gaz’d at the Ship, <em class="calibre6">till</em> and <em class="calibre6">after</em> I had landed, as long as I could discern the least Appearance of it; for she was under Sail, in a manner, when I left her: And so I return’d, highly disturb’d, to my Inn.</p>
<p class="indent">I went to-bed, but rested not; return’d to <em class="calibre6">London</em> the next Morning; and set out that Afternoon again, for the Country. And so much, my Dear, for poor <em class="calibre6">Sally Godfrey</em>.—She sends, I understand, by all Opportunities, with the Knowledge of her Husband, to learn how her Child, by her first Husband, does; and has the Satisfaction to know she is happily provided for. And, about half a Year ago, her Spouse sent a little Negro Boy, of about ten Years old, as a Present, to wait upon her. But he was taken ill of the Small-pox, and died in a Month after he was landed.</p>
<p class="indent">Sure, Sir, said I, your generous Mind must have been long affected with this melancholy Case, and all its Circumstances. It hung upon me, indeed, some time, said he; but I was full of Spirits and Inconsideration. I went soon after to travel; a hundred new Objects danced before my Eyes, and kept Reflection from me. And, you see, I had, five or six Years afterwards, and even before that, so thoroughly lost all the Impressions you talk of, that I doubted not to make my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> change her Name, without either Act of Parliament or Wedlock, and be <em class="calibre6">Sally Godfrey</em> the Second.</p>
<p class="indent">O you dear naughty Gentleman! said I, this seems but too true! But I bless God that it is not so!—I bless God for your Reformation, and that for your own dear sake, as well as mine!</p>
<p class="indent">Well, my Dear, said he, and I bless God for it too!—I do most sincerely!—And ’tis my greater Pleasure, because I have, as I hope, seen my Error so early; and that, with such a Stock of Youth and <a id="page_487"></a>Health of my Side, in all Appearance, I can truly abhor my past Liberties, and pity poor <em class="calibre6">Sally Godfrey</em>, from the same Motives that I admire my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>’s Virtues; and resolve, by the Grace of God, to make myself as worthy of them as possible: And I will hope, my Dear, your Prayers for my Pardon and my Perseverance, will be of no small Efficacy on this Occasion.</p>
<p class="indent">These agreeable Reflections, on this melancholy, but instructive, Story, brought us in View of his own House; and we alighted, and took a Walk in the Garden till Dinner was ready. And now we are so busy about making ready for our Appearance, that I shall hardly have time to write till that be over.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">MONDAY Morning</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">Yesterday we set out, attended by <em class="calibre6">John, Abraham, Benjamin</em> and <em class="calibre6">Isaac</em>, in fine new Liveries, in the best Chariot, which had been new clean’d, and lin’d, and new harness’d; so that it look’d like a quite new one: But I had no Arms to quarter with my dear Spouse’s; tho’ he jocularly, upon my taking Notice of my Obscurity, said, that he had a good mind to have the Olive-branch, which would allude to his Hopes, quarter’d for mine.<a id="exp-note_111"></a><a href="part0021_split_111.html#exp-note-111" class="nounder">*</a> I was dress’d in the Suit I mention’d, of White flower’d with Gold, and a rich Head-dress, and the Diamond Necklace, Ear-rings, <em class="calibre6">&amp;c</em>. I also mention’d before. And my dear Sir, in a fine laced silk Waistcoat, of blue Paduasoy, and his Coat a pearl-colour’d fine Cloth, with gold Buttons and Button-holes, and lin’d with white Silk; and he look’d charmingly indeed. I said, I was too fine, and would have laid aside some of the Jewels; but he said, It would be thought a Slight to me from him, as his Wife; and tho’, as I apprehended, it might be, that People would talk as it was, yet he had rather they should say any thing, than that I was not put upon an equal Foot, as his Wife, with any Lady he might have marry’d.</p>
<p class="indent">It seems, the neighbouring Gentry had expected us; and there was a great Congregation; for (against my Wish) we were a little of the latest; so that, as we walked up the Church to his Seat, we had abundance of Gazers, and Whisperers: But my dear Master behav’d with so intrepid an Air, and was so chearful and complaisant to me, that he did Credit to his kind Choice, instead of shewing as if he was asham’d of it; and as I was resolved to busy my Mind intirely with the Duties of the Day, my Intentness on that Occasion, and my <a id="page_488"></a>Thankfulness to God, for his unspeakable Mercies to me, so took up my Attention, that I was much less concern’d than I should otherwise have been, at the Gazings and Whisperings of the Ladies and Gentlemen, as well as of the rest of the Congregation; whose Eyes were all turn’d to our Seat.</p>
<p class="indent">When the Sermon was ended, we staid the longer, because the Church should be pretty empty; but we found great Numbers at the Church Doors, and in the Church Porch; and I had the Pleasure of hearing many Commendations, as well of my Person, as my Dress and Behaviour, and not one Reflection, or Mark of Disrespect. ’Squire <em class="calibre6">Martin</em>, who is single, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Chambers</em>, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Arthur</em>, and Mr. <em class="calibre6">Brooks</em>, with their Families, were all there: And the four Gentlemen came up to us, before we went into the Chariot, and, in a very kind and respectful manner, complimented me, and my dear Sir; and Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Arthur</em>, and Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Brooks</em>, were so kind as to wish me Joy; and Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Brooks</em> said, You sent my Spouse, Madam, home, t’other Day, quite charm’d with that easy and sweet Manner, which you have convinced a thousand Persons, this Day, is so natural to you.</p>
<p class="indent">You do me great Honour, Madam, reply’d I. Such a good Lady’s Approbation must make me too sensible of my Happiness. My dear Master handed me into the Chariot, and stood talking with Sir <em class="calibre6">Thomas Atkyns</em>, at the Door of it, (who was making him abundance of Compliments, and is a very ceremonious Gentleman, a little to Extremes) and I believe, to familiarize me to the Gazers, which concern’d me a little. For I was dash’d to hear the Praises of the Country People, and to see how they crouded about the Chariot. Several poor People begg’d my Charity, and I beckon’d <em class="calibre6">John</em> with my Fan, and said, Divide, in the further Church-Porch, that Money to the Poor, and let them come to-morrow Morning to me, and I will give them something more, if they don’t importune me now.—So I gave him all the Silver I had, which happen’d to be between twenty and thirty Shillings; and this drew away from me, their clamorous Prayers for Charity.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. <em class="calibre6">Martin</em> came up to me on the other side of the Chariot, and lean’d on the Door, while my Master was talking to Sir <em class="calibre6">Thomas</em>, from whom he could not get away, and said, By all that’s good, you have charm’d the whole Congregation. Not a Soul but is full of your Praises. My Neighbour knew, better than any body could tell him, <a id="page_489"></a>how to chuse for himself. Why, said he, the Dean himself look’d more upon you than his Book.</p>
<p class="indent">O Sir, said I, you are very encouraging to a weak Mind! I vow, said he, I say no more than’s Truth: I’d marry to-morrow, if I was sure of meeting with a Person of but one half of the Merit you have. You are, said he, and ’tis not my way to praise too much, an Ornament to your Sex, an Honour to your Spouse, and a Credit to Religion!—Every body is saying so, added he; for you have, by your Piety, edified the whole Church.</p>
<p class="indent">As he had done speaking, the Dean himself complimented me, that the Behaviour of so sweet a Bride would be very edifying to his Congregation, and encouraging to himself. Sir, said I, you are very kind. I hope I shall not behave unworthy of the good Instructions I shall have the Pleasure to receive from so worthy a Divine. He bow’d, and went on.</p>
<p class="indent">Sir <em class="calibre6">Thomas</em> then apply’d to me, my Master stepping into the Chariot, and said, I beg Pardon, Madam, for detaining your good Spouse from you. But I have been saying, he is the happiest Man in the World. I bow’d to him; but I could have wish’d him further, to make me sit so in the Notice of every one; which, for all I could do, dash’d me not a little.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. <em class="calibre6">Martin</em> said to my Master, If you’ll come to Church every <em class="calibre6">Sunday</em>, with your charming Lady, I will never absent myself, and she’ll give a good Example to all the Neighbourhood. O, my dear Sir, said I, to my Master, You know not how much I am obliged to good Mr. <em class="calibre6">Martin</em>. He has, by his kind Expressions, made me dare to look up with Pleasure and Gratitude.</p>
<p class="indent">Said my Master, My dear Love, I am very much oblig’d, as well as you, to my good Friend Mr. <em class="calibre6">Martin</em>. And he said to him, We will constantly go to Church, and to every other Place, where we can have the Pleasure of seeing Mr. <em class="calibre6">Martin</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. <em class="calibre6">Martin</em> said, Gad, Sir, you are a happy Man; and I think your Lady’s Example has made you more polite, and handsome too, than I ever knew you before, tho’ we never thought you unpolite neither. And so he bow’d, and went to his own Chariot; and as we drove away, the People kindly blessed us, and called us a charming Pair. As I have no other Pride, I hope, in repeating these things, than in the Countenance the general Approbation gives to my dear Master for his stooping so low, you will excuse me for it, I know.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_490"></a>In the Afternoon, we went again to Church, and a little early, at my Request; but the Church was quite full, and soon after even crowded; so much does Novelty, the more’s the Pity! attract the Eyes of Mankind. ’Squire <em class="calibre6">Martin</em> came in, after us, and made up to our Seat, and said, If you please, my dear Friend, I will take my Seat with you this Afternoon. With all my Heart, said my Master. I was sorry for it; but was resolved my Duty should not be made second to Bashfulness, or any other Consideration; and when Divine Service began, I withdrew to the further End of the Pew, and left the Gentlemen in the Front; and they behav’d quite suitably, both of them, to the Occasion. I mention this the rather, because Mr. <em class="calibre6">Martin</em> was not very noted for coming to Church, or Attention when there, before.</p>
<p class="indent">The Dean preached again, which he was not used to do, out of Compliment to us; and an excellent Sermon he made on the relative Duties of Christianity; and it took my peculiar Attention; for he made many fine Observations on the Subject. Mr. <em class="calibre6">Martin</em> address’d himself twice or thrice to me, during the Sermon; but he saw me so wholly engross’d with hearkening to the good Preacher, that he forbore interrupting me; yet I took care, according to my dear Sir’s Lesson, formerly, to observe to him a chearful and obliging Behaviour, as one of his Friends and Intimates. My Master ask’d him to give him his Company to Supper; and he said, I am so taken with your Lady, that you must not give me too much Encouragement; for I shall be always with you, if you do. He was pleased to say, You cannot favour us with too much of your Company; and as I have left you in the Lurch, in your single State, I think you will do well to oblige us as much as you can; and who knows but my Happiness may reform another Rake? <em class="calibre6">Who</em> knows?—said Mr. <em class="calibre6">Martin</em>—Why, I know!—for I am more than half reform’d already.</p>
<p class="indent">At the Chariot-door, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Arthur</em>, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Brooks</em>, Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Chambers</em>, were brought to me, by their respective Spouses; and presently, the witty Lady <em class="calibre6">Towers</em>, who banter’d me before, (as I once told you) join’d them; and Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Arthur</em> said, She wished me Joy: And that all the good Ladies, my Neighbours, would collect themselves together, and make me a Visit. This, said I, will be an Honour, Madam, that I can never enough acknowledge. It will be very kind so to countenance a Person, who will always study to deserve your Favour, by the most respectful Behaviour.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_491"></a>Lady <em class="calibre6">Towers</em> said, My dear Neighbour, you want no Countenance; your own Merit is sufficient. I had a slight Cold, that kept me at home in the Morning; but I heard you so much talk’d of, and prais’d, that I resolved not to stay away in the Afternoon. And I join in the Joy every one gives you. She turn’d to my Master, and said, You are a sly Thief, as I always thought you. Where have you stolen this Lady! And now, how barbarous is it, thus, unawares in a manner, to bring her here upon us, to mortify and eclipse us all!—You are very kind, Madam, said he, that you, and all my worthy Neighbours, see with my Eyes. But had I not known she had so much Excellency of Mind and Behaviour, as would strike every body in her Favour at first Sight, I should not have dared to class her with such of my worthy Neighbours, as now so kindly congratulate us both.</p>
<p class="indent">I own, said she, softly, I was one of your Censurers; but I never lik’d you so well in my Life, as for this Action, now I see how capable your Bride is of giving Distinction to any Condition.—And coming to me, My dear Neighbour, said she, excuse me for having but in my Thought, the Remembrance that I have <em class="calibre6">seen you formerly</em>, when, by your sweet Air, and easy Deportment, you so much surpass us all, and give Credit to your present happy Condition.</p>
<p class="indent">Dear good Madam, said I, how shall I suitably return my Acknowledgments! But it will never be a Pain to me to look back upon my <em class="calibre6">former Days</em>, now I have the kind Allowance and Example of so many worthy Ladies to support me in the Honours to which the most generous of Men has raised me.</p>
<p class="indent">Sweetly said! she was pleased to say. If I was in another Place, I would kiss you for that Answer. Oh! happy, happy, Mr. <em class="calibre6">B</em>. said she to my Master; what Reputation have you not brought upon your Judgment!—I won’t be long before I see you, added she, I’ll assure you, if I come by myself. That shall be your own Fault, Madam, said Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Brooks</em>, if you do.</p>
<p class="indent">And so they took Leave; and I gave my Hand to my dear Sir, and said, How happy have you made me, generous Sir!—And the Dean, who was just come up, heard me, and said, And how happy you have made your Spouse, I’ll venture to pronounce, is hard to say, from what I observe of you both. I curt’sy’d, and blush’d, not thinking any body heard me. And my Master telling him he should be glad of the Honour of a Visit from him; he said, He would pay his Respects to us, the first Opportunity, and would bring his Wife and Daughter to <a id="page_492"></a>attend me. I said, That was doubly kind; and I should be very proud of cultivating so worthy an Acquaintance. I thanked him for his fine Discourse; and he thanked me for my Attention to it, which he called Exemplary: And so my dear Sir handed me into the Chariot; and we were carried home, <em class="calibre6">both</em> happy, and <em class="calibre6">both</em> pleased, thank God!<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">Mr. <em class="calibre6">Martin</em> came in the Evening, with another Gentleman, his Friend, one Mr. <em class="calibre6">Dormer;</em> and he entertained us with the favourable Opinion, he said, every one had of me, and of the Choice my good Benefactor had made.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">This Morning the Poor came, according to my Invitation; and I sent them away with glad Hearts, to the Number of Twenty-five. They were not above Twelve or Fourteen, on <em class="calibre6">Sunday</em>, that <em class="calibre6">John</em> divided the Silver I gave among them; but others got hold of the Matter, and made up to the above Number.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">TUESDAY</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">MY generous Master has given me, this Morning, a most considerate, but yet, from the Nature of it, melancholy Instance of his great Regard for my Unworthiness, which I never could have wished, hoped for, or even thought of.</p>
<p class="indent">He took a Walk with me, after Breakfast, into the Garden; and a little Shower falling, he led me, for Shelter, into the little Summer-house, in the private Garden, where he formerly gave me Apprehensions; and sitting down by me, he said, I have now finish’d all that lies on my Mind, my Dear, and am very easy: For have you not wonder’d, that I have so much employ’d myself in my Library? Been so much at home, and yet not in your Company?—No, Sir, said I, I have never been so impertinent as to wonder at any thing you please to employ yourself about; nor would give way to a Curiosity that should be troublesome to you: And besides, I know your large Possessions, and the Method you take of looking yourself into your Affairs, must needs take up some Portions of your Time, that I ought to be very careful how I invade.</p>
<p class="indent">Well, said he, but I’ll tell you what has been my last Work: I have taken it into my Consideration, that, at present, my Line is almost extinct; and a great Part of my Estate, in case I die without Issue, will go to another Line; and other Parts of my personal Estate, will go <a id="page_493"></a>into such Hands, as I should not care my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> should lie at their Mercy. I have therefore, as human Life is uncertain, made such a Disposition of my Affairs, as will make you absolutely independent and happy; as will secure to you the Power of doing a great deal of Good; and living as a Person ought to do, who is my Relict; and shall put it out of any body’s Power to molest your Father and Mother, in the Provision I design them, for the Remainder of their Days: And I have finish’d all this very Morning, except to naming Trustees for you; and if you have any body you would confide in more than another, I would have you speak.</p>
<p class="indent">I was so touch’d with this mournful Instance of his excessive Goodness to me, and the Thoughts necessarily flowing from the solemn Occasion, that I was unable to speak, and at last reliev’d my Mind by a violent Fit of weeping; and could only say, clasping my Arms around the dear generous Gentleman! How shall I support this! So very cruel, yet so very kind!</p>
<p class="indent">Don’t, my Dear, said he, be concern’d at what gives me Pleasure. I am not the nearer my End, for having made this Disposition; but I think the putting off these materials Points, when so many Accidents every Day happen, and Life is so precarious, is one of the most inexcusable Things in the World. And there are so many important Points to be thought of, when Life is drawing to its utmost Verge; and the Mind may be so agitated and unfit, that it is a most sad thing to put off, to that Time, any of those Concerns, which more especially require a considerate and composed Frame of Temper, and perfect Health and Vigor to manage. My poor Friend, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Carlton</em>, who died in my Arms so lately, and had a Mind disturb’d by worldly Considerations on one side, a Weakness of Body, thro’ his Distemper’s Violence, on another, and the Concerns of still as much more Moment, as the Soul is to the Body, on a third, made so great an Impression upon me then, that I was the more impatient to come to this House, where were most of my Writings, in order to make the Disposition I have now perfected: And since it is grievous to my dear Girl, I will think myself of such Trustees, as shall be most for her Benefit. I have only therefore to assure you, my Dear, that in this Instance, as I will do in every other I can think of, I have studied to make you quite easy, free, and independent. And because I shall avoid all Occasions, for the future, which may discompose you, I have but one Request to make; which is, That if it please God, for my <a id="page_494"></a>Sins, to separate me from my dearest <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, that you will only resolve not to marry <em class="calibre6">one</em> Person; for I would not be such an <em class="calibre6">Herod<a id="exp-note_112"></a><a href="part0021_split_112.html#exp-note-112" class="nounder">*</a></em> as to restrict you from a Change of Condition with any other, however reluctantly I may think of any other Person succeeding me in your Esteem.</p>
<p class="indent">I could not answer, and thought my Heart would have burst. And he continued, To conclude at once, a Subject that is so grievous to you, I will tell you, my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, that this Person is Mr. <em class="calibre6">Williams</em>: And now I will acquaint you with my Motive for this Request; which is wholly owing to my Niceness, and to no Dislike I have for him, or Apprehension of any Likelihood that it will be so: But, methinks, it would reflect a little upon my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, if she was to give way to such a Conduct, as if she had marry’d a Man for his <em class="calibre6">Estate</em>, when she had rather have had <em class="calibre6">another</em>, had it not been for <em class="calibre6">that;</em> and that now, the World will say, she is at Liberty to pursue her Inclination, the Parson is the Man!—And I cannot bear even the most distant Apprehension, that I had not the Preference with you, of any Man living, let me have been what I would; as I have shewn my dear Life, that I have preferr’d her to all her Sex, of whatever Degree.</p>
<p class="indent">I could not speak, might I have had the World; and he took me in his Arms, and said, I have now spoken all my Mind, and expect no Answer; and I see you too much mov’d to give me one.—Only forgive me the Mention, as I have told you my Motive; which as much affects your Reputation as my Niceness; and offer not at an Answer;—only say, You forgive me. And I hope I have not one discomposing thing to say to my Dearest, for the rest of my Life; which, I pray God, for both our sakes, to lengthen for many happy Years.</p>
<p class="indent">Grief still choaked up the Passage of my Words; and he said, The Shower is over, my Dear, let us walk out again.—He led me by the Hand, and I would have spoke; but he said, I will not hear my dear Creature say any thing: To hearken to your Assurance of complying with my Request, would look as if I doubted you, and wanted it. I am confident I needed only to speak my Mind, to be observed by you; and I shall never more think of the Subject, if you don’t remind me of it. He then most sweetly chang’d the Discourse.</p>
<p class="indent">Don’t you with Pleasure, my Dear, said he, take in the delightful Fragrance that this sweet Shower has given to these Banks of Flowers? Your <em class="calibre6">Presence</em> is so enlivening to me, that I could almost fansy, that what we owe to the <em class="calibre6">Shower</em>, is owing to <em class="calibre6">That</em>: And all <a id="page_495"></a>Nature, methinks, blooms around me, when I have my <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> by my Side. You are a Poetess, my Dear; and I will give you a few Lines, that I made myself on such an Occasion as this I am speaking of, the Presence of a sweet Companion, and the fresh Verdure, that, after a Shower succeeding a long Draught, shew’d itself throughout all vegetable Nature. And then in a sweet and easy Accent, (with his dear Arms about me as we walk’d) he sung me the following Verses; of which he afterwards favour’d me with a Copy.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="center1">I.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">ALL Nature blooms when you appear;<br class="calibre3"/>The Fields their richest Liv’ries wear;<br class="calibre3"/>Oaks, Elms and Pines, blest with your View,<br class="calibre3"/>Shoot out fresh Greens, and bud anew.<br class="calibre3"/>   The varying Seasons you supply;<br class="calibre3"/>   And when you’re gone, they fade and die</em>.</p>
<p class="center1">II.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">Sweet</em> Philomel, <em class="calibre6">in mournful Strains,<br class="calibre3"/>To you appeals, to you complains.<br class="calibre3"/>The tow’ring Lark, on rising Wing,<br class="calibre3"/>Warbles to you, your Praise does sing;<br class="calibre3"/>   He cuts the yielding Air, and flies<br class="calibre3"/>   To Heav’n, to type your future Joys</em>.</p>
<p class="center1">III.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">The purple Violet, damask Rose,<br class="calibre3"/>Each to delight your Senses blows.<br class="calibre3"/>The Lilies ope’, as you appear,<br class="calibre3"/>And all the Beauties of the Year<br class="calibre3"/>   Diffuse their Odors at your Feet,<br class="calibre3"/>   Who give to ev’ry Flow’r its Sweet</em>.</p>
<p class="center1">IV.</p>
<p class="poem"><em class="calibre6">For Flow’rs and Women are ally’d;<br class="calibre3"/>Both, Nature’s Glory, and her Pride!<br class="calibre3"/>Of ev’ry fragrant Sweet possest,<br class="calibre3"/>They bloom but for the Fair One’s Breast;<br class="calibre3"/>   And to the swelling Bosom born,<br class="calibre3"/>   Each other mutually adorn<a id="exp-note_113"></a><a href="part0021_split_113.html#exp-note-113" class="nounder">*</a></em></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_496"></a>Thus sweetly did he palliate the Woes, which the Generosity of his Actions, mix’d with the Solemness of the Occasion, and the strange Request he had vouchsafed to make me, had occasion’d. And all he would permit me to say, was, That I was not displeased with him!—Displeased with you, dearest Sir! said I: Let me thus testify my Obligations, and the Force all your Commands shall have upon me. And I took the Liberty to clasp my Arms about his Neck, and kissed him.</p>
<p class="indent">But yet my Mind was pained at times, and has been to this Hour.—God grant that I may never see the dreadful Moment, that shall shut up the precious Life of this excellently generous Benefactor of mine! And—but I cannot bear to suppose—I cannot say more on such a deep Subject!</p>
<p class="indent">Oh! what a poor thing is human Life in its best Enjoyments!—subjected to <em class="calibre6">imaginary</em> Evils, when it has no <em class="calibre6">real</em> ones to disturb it! and that can be made as effectually unhappy by its Apprehensions of remote Contingencies, as if it was struggling with the Pangs of a present Distress! This, duly reflected upon, methinks, should convince every one, that this World is not a Place for the immortal Mind to be confined to; and that there must be an Hereafter, where the <em class="calibre6">whole</em> Soul shall be satisfy’d.</p>
<p class="indent">But I shall get out of my Depth; my shallow Mind cannot comprehend, as it ought, these weighty Subjects: Let me, therefore, only pray, that after having made a grateful Use of God’s Mercies here, I may, with my dear Benefactor, rejoice in that happy State, where is no Mixture, no Unsatisfiedness; and where all is Joy, and Peace, and Love, for evermore!</p>
<p class="indent">I said, when we sat at Supper, The charming Taste you gave me, Sir, of your poetical Fancy, makes me sure you have more Favours of this Kind, to delight me with, if you please; and may I beg to be indulged on this agreeable Head?—Hitherto, said he, my Life has been too much a Life of Gaiety and Action, to be busy’d so innocently. Some little Essays I have now-and-then attempted; but very few have I completed. Indeed I had not Patience nor Attention enough to hold me long to any one thing. Now-and-then, perhaps, I may occasionally shew you what I have attempted. But I never could please myself in this way.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><a id="page_497"></a><em class="calibre6">FRIDAY</em>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">WE were Yesterday favour’d with the Company of almost all the neighbouring Gentry, and their good Ladies, who, by Appointment with one another, met to congratulate our Happiness. Nothing could be more obliging, more free and affectionate, than the Ladies; nothing more polite than the Gentlemen. All was perform’d, (for they came to Supper,) with Decency and Order, and much to every one’s Satisfaction, which was principally owing to good Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>’s Care and Skill; who is an excellent Manager.</p>
<p class="indent">For my part, I was dress’d out, only to be admir’d, as it seems; and truly, if I had not known, that I did not make <em class="calibre6">myself</em>, as you, my dear Father, once hinted to me; and if I had had the Vanity to think as well of myself, as the good Company was pleased to do, I might possibly have been proud. But I know, as my Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> said, tho’ in Anger, yet in Truth, that I am but <em class="calibre6">a poor Bit of painted Dirt</em>. All that I value myself upon, is, that God has raised me to a Condition to be useful in my Generation, to better Persons than myself. This is my Pride: And I hope this will be <em class="calibre6">all</em> my Pride. For what was I of myself!—All the Good I can do, is but a poor third-hand Good; for my dearest Master himself is but the Second-hand. G<small class="calibre2">OD</small>, the All-gracious, the All-good, the All-bountiful, the All-mighty, the All-merciful G<small class="calibre2">OD</small>, is the First: To HIM, therefore, be all the Glory!</p>
<p class="indent">As I expect the Happiness, the unspeakable Happiness, my ever-dear and ever-honour’d Father and Mother, of enjoying you both here, under this Roof, so soon, (and pray let it be as soon as you can) I will not enter into the Particulars of the last agreeable Evening: For I shall have a thousand things, as well as that, to talk to you upon. I fear you will be tir’d with my Prattle when I see you!</p>
<p class="indent">I am to return these Visits singly; and there were Eight Ladies here, of different Families. Dear Heart, I shall find enough to do!—I doubt my Time will not be so well filled up, as I once promised my dear Sir!—But he is pleas’d, chearful, kind, affectionate! O what a happy Creature am I!—May I be always thankful to G<small class="calibre2">OD</small>, and grateful to <em class="calibre6">him!</em>—When all these tumultuous Visitings are over, I shall have my Mind, I hope, subside into a Family Calm, that I may make myself a little useful to the Houshold of my dear Master; or else I shall be an unprofitable Servant indeed!</p>
<p class="indent">Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> sent this Morning her Compliments to us both, very <a id="page_498"></a>affectionately; and her Lord’s good Wishes and Congratulations. And she desir’d my Writings <em class="calibre6">per</em> Bearer; and says, she will herself bring them to me again, with Thanks, as soon as she has read them; and she and her Lord will come and be <em class="calibre6">my</em> Guests (that was her particularly kind Word) for a Fortnight.</p>
<p class="indent">I have now but one thing to wish for, and then, methinks, I shall be all Ecstasy; and that is, Your Presence, both of you, and your Blessings; which I hope you will bestow upon me every Morning and Night, till you are settled in the happy manner my dear Spouse has intended.</p>
<p class="indent">Methinks I want sadly your List of the honest and worthy Poor; for the Money lies by me, and brings me no Interest. You see I am become a mere Usurer; and want to make Use upon Use: And yet, when I have done all, I cannot do so much as I ought. God forgive my Imperfections!</p>
<p class="indent">I tell my dear Sir, I want another Dairy-house Visit. To be sure, if he won’t, at <em class="calibre6">present</em>, permit it, I shall, if it please God to spare us, tieze him like any over-indulged Wife, if, as the dear Charmer grows <em class="calibre6">older</em>, he won’t let me have the Pleasure of forming her tender Mind, as well as I am able, lest, poor little Soul! she fall into such Snares as her unhappy dear Mother fell into. I am providing a Power of pretty Things for her, against I see her next, that I may make her love me, if I can.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">Just now I have the blessed News, that you will set out, for this happy House, on <em class="calibre6">Tuesday</em> Morning. The Chariot shall be with you without fail. God give us a happy Meeting! O, how I long for it! Forgive your impatient Daughter, who sends this, to amuse you on your Journey; and desires to be</p>
<p class="right"><em class="calibre6">Ever most dutifully Yours</em>.</p>
<hr class="calibre26"/>
<p class="noindent">HERE end the Letters of the incomparable P<small class="calibre2">AMELA</small> to her Father and Mother. For, as they arriv’d at their Daughter’s House on <em class="calibre6">Tuesday</em> Evening in the following Week, she had no Occasion to continue her Journal longer.</p>
<p class="indent">The good old Couple were receiv’d, by her, with the utmost Joy and Duty; and with great Goodness and Complaisance by her <a id="page_499"></a>generous Spouse. And having resided there till every thing was put in Order for them at the <em class="calibre6">Kentish</em> Estate, they were carried down thither by the ’Squire himself, and their Daughter, and put into Possession of the pretty Farm he had designed for them. In which they long liv’d comfortably, doing Good by their Examples, and their judicious Charities, to all about them.</p>
<p class="indent">They constantly, twice in every Year, for a Fortnight together, so long as they liv’d, visited their dear Daughter; and once a Year, at least, for a Week at a time, were visited by them again: And the ’Squire having added, by new Purchases, to that Estate, they, by their Diligence, augmented the Value of it, and deserved of him the Kindness he shew’d them.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">As for the excellent P<small class="calibre2">AMELA</small>, she enjoy’d, for many Years, the Reward of her Virtue, Piety and Charity; exceedingly beloved by both Sexes, and by all Degrees; and was look’d upon as the Mirror of her Age and Sex.</p>
<p class="indent">She made her beloved Spouse happy in a numerous and hopeful Progeny. And he made her the best and fondest of Husbands; and, after her Example, became remarkable for Piety, Virtue, and all the Social Duties of a Man and a Christian. And they charm’d every one within the Circle of their Acquaintance, by the Sweetness of their Manners, the regular Order and Oeconomy of their Houshold; by their chearful Hospitality, and a diffusive Charity to all worthy Objects within the Compass of their Knowledge.</p>
<p class="indent">She was regularly visited by the principal Ladies in the Neighbourhood; who were fond of her Acquaintance, and better’d by her Example.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> became one of her sincerest and most affectionate Admirers. And her Lord, in a manner, doated upon her.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">The poor little Miss <em class="calibre6">Goodwin</em> was, after a while, given up to her Wishes and Importunities, in order to be form’d by her Example; and, in Process of Time, was joined in Marriage with a Gentleman of Merit and Fortune, to whom she made an excellent Wife.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_500"></a>HAVING thus brought this little History to a happy Period, the Reader will indulge us in a few brief Observations, which naturally result from it; and which will serve as so many Applications, of its most material Incidents, to the Minds of the Youth of both Sexes.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">First, then, in the Character of the G<small class="calibre2">ENTLEMAN</small>, may be seen that of a fashionable Libertine, who allow’d himself in the free Indulgence of his Passions, especially as to the Fair Sex; and found himself supported in his daring Attempts, by an affluent Fortune in Possession, a personal Bravery, as it is called, readier to give than take Offence, and an imperious Will; yet as he betimes sees his Errors, and reforms in the Bloom of Youth, an edifying Lesson may be drawn from it, for the Use of such as are born to large Fortunes; and who may be taught, by his Example, the inexpressible Difference between the Hazards and Remorse which attend a profligate Course of Life; and the Pleasures which flow from virtuous Love, and virtuous Actions.</p>
<p class="indent">The Generosity of his Mind; his Sobriety, as to <em class="calibre6">Wine</em> and <em class="calibre6">Hours;</em> his prudent Oeconomy and Hospitality; the Purity and Constancy of his Affection, after his Change; his polite Behaviour to his <em class="calibre6">Pamela;</em> his generous Provision for her, in case he had died; his Bounty to her Parents, attended with such Marks of Prudence as made them useful to <em class="calibre6">himself</em>, as well as render’d <em class="calibre6">them</em> happy; and shew’d he was not acted merely by a blind and partial Passion; are so many Instances worthy of being remember’d in his Favour, and of being imitated, in Degree, by all such as are circumstanced as he was.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">In the Character of Lady D<small class="calibre2">AVERS</small>, let the Proud and the Highborn see the Deformity of unreasonable Passion, and how weak and ridiculous such Persons must appear, who suffer themselves, as is usually the Case, to be hurried from one Extreme to another; from the Height of Violence, to the most abject Submission; and subject themselves to be out-done by the humble Virtue they so much despise.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">Let good C<small class="calibre2">LERGYMEN</small>, in Mr. W<small class="calibre2">ILLIAMS</small>, see that whatever Displeasure the doing of their Duty may give, for a Time, to their proud Patrons, Providence will, at last, reward their Piety, and turn <a id="page_501"></a>their Distresses to Triumph; and make them even <em class="calibre6">more</em> valued for a Conduct that gave Offence while the Violence of Passion lasted, than if they had meanly stoop’d to flatter or sooth the Vices of the Great.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">In the Examples of good old A<small class="calibre2">NDREWS</small>, and his W<small class="calibre2">IFE</small>, let those, who are reduced to a low Estate, see, that Providence never fails to reward their Honesty and Integrity; and that God will, in his own good Time, extricate them, by means unforeseen, out of their present Difficulties, and reward them with Benefits unhop’d-for.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">The U<small class="calibre2">PPER</small> S<small class="calibre2">ERVANTS</small> of great Families may, from the odious Character of Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>, and the amiable ones of Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jervis</em>, Mr. <em class="calibre6">Longman</em>, &amp;c. learn what to avoid, and what to chuse, to make themselves valued and esteem’d by all who know them.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">And, from the double Conduct of poor <em class="calibre6">John</em>, the L<small class="calibre2">OWER</small> S<small class="calibre2">ERVANTS</small> may learn Fidelity, and how to distinguish between the lawful and unlawful Commands of a Superior.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">The poor deluded Female, who, like the once unhappy Miss G<small class="calibre2">ODFREY</small>, has given up her Honour, and yielded to the Allurements of her designing Lover, may learn from her Story, to stop at the <em class="calibre6">first Fault;</em> and, by resolving to repent and amend, see the Pardon and Blessing which await her Penitence, and a kind Providence ready to extend the Arms of its Mercy to receive and reward her returning Duty. While the abandon’d Prostitute, pursuing the wicked Courses, into which, perhaps, she was at first <em class="calibre6">inadvertently</em> drawn, hurries herself into filthy Diseases, and an untimely Death; and, too probably, into everlasting Perdition afterwards.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">Let the <em class="calibre6">desponding Heart</em> be comforted by the happy Issue which the Troubles and Trials of the lovely P<small class="calibre2">AMELA</small> met with, when they see, in her Case, that no Danger nor Distress, however inevitable or deep to their Apprehensions, can be out of the Power of Providence to obviate or relieve; and which, as in various Instances in her Story, can turn the most seemingly grievous Things to its own Glory, and the Reward of suffering Innocence; and that, too, at a Time when all human Prospects seem to fail.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">Let the <em class="calibre6">Rich</em>, and those who are <em class="calibre6">exalted</em> from a <em class="calibre6">low</em> to a <em class="calibre6">high Estate</em>, <a id="page_502"></a>learn from her, that they are not promoted only for a <em class="calibre6">single Good;</em> but that Providence has raised them, that they should dispense to all within their Reach, the Blessings it has heaped upon them; and that the greater the Power is to which G<small class="calibre2">OD</small> has raised them, the greater is the Good that will be expected from them.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">From the low Opinion she every-where shews of herself, and her attributing all her Excellencies to her pious Education, and her Lady’s virtuous Instructions and Bounty; let Persons, even of <em class="calibre6">Genius</em> and <em class="calibre6">Piety</em>, learn, not to arrogate to themselves those Gifts and Graces, which they owe least of all to themselves: Since the Beauties of Person are frail, and it is not in our Power to give them to ourselves, or to be either prudent, wise, or good, without the Assistance of Divine Grace.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">From the same good Example, let <em class="calibre6">Children</em> see what a Blessing awaits their Duty to their Parents, tho’ ever so low in the World: And that the only Disgrace is to be dishonest; but none at all to be poor.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">From the <em class="calibre6">Oeconomy</em> she purposes to observe in her Elevation, let even <em class="calibre6">Ladies of Condition</em> learn, that there are Family Employments in which they may, and ought to, make themselves useful, and give good Examples to their Inferiors, as well as Equals. And that their Duty to God, Charity to the Poor and Sick, and the different Branches of Houshold Management, ought to take up the most considerable Portions of their Time.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">From her signal <em class="calibre6">Veracity</em>, which she never forfeited, in all the Hardships she was try’d with, tho’ her Answers, as she had Reason to apprehend, would often make against her; and the Innocence she preserved throughout all her Stratagems and Contrivances to save herself from Violation; Persons, even <em class="calibre6">sorely tempted</em>, may learn to preserve a sacred Regard to <em class="calibre6">Truth;</em> which always begets a Reverence for them, even in the corruptest Minds.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">In short,<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="hangingpara">Her obliging Behaviour to her Equals, before her Exaltation; her Kindness to them afterwards; her forgiving Spirit, and her Generosity;</p>
<p class="hangingpara"><a id="page_503"></a>Her Meekness, in every Circumstance where her Virtue was not concern’d;</p>
<p class="hangingpara">Her charitable Allowances for others, as in the Case of Miss <em class="calibre6">Godfrey</em>, for Faults she would not have forgiven in herself;</p>
<p class="hangingpara">Her Kindness and Prudence to the Offspring of that melancholy Adventure;</p>
<p class="hangingpara">Her Maiden and Bridal Purity, which extended as well to her Thoughts as to her Words and Actions;</p>
<p class="hangingpara">Her signal Affiance in God;</p>
<p class="hangingpara">Her thankful Spirit;</p>
<p class="hangingpara">Her grateful Heart;</p>
<p class="hangingpara">Her diffusive Charity to the Poor, which made her blessed by them whenever she appear’d abroad;</p>
<p class="hangingpara">The chearful Ease and Freedom of her Deportment;</p>
<p class="hangingpara">Her Parental, Conjugal and Maternal Duty;</p>
<p class="hangingpara">Her Social Virtues;<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">Are all so many signal Instances of the Excellency of her Mind; which may make her Character worthy of the Imitation of her Sex, from low to high Life. And the Editor of these Sheets will have his End, if it inspires a laudable Emulation in the Minds of any worthy Persons, who may thereby intitle themselves to the Rewards, the Praises, and the Blessings, by which she was so deservedly distinguished.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
