<p class="blockquote3">Published on 14 February 1741, the second edition of <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> supplemented the preface and commendations of the first edition with the following introduction, drawn mainly from letters written to Richardson in the intervening weeks by the poet and critic Aaron Hill. Mercilessly ridiculed in Fielding’s <em class="calibre6">Shamela</em>, and widely disparaged elsewhere, the introduction was replaced in the octavo sixth edition of May 1742 by a lengthy table of contents. It survived, however, in the seventh edition of 1754 (in which Richardson reverted to the duodecimo format of the first five editions) and in the immediately posthumous eighth edition (duodecimo again) of 1761. A facsimile reprint made from the Huntington Library copy of the second edition <em class="calibre6">(Samuel Richardson’s Introduction to Pamela</em>, ed. Sheridan W. Baker, Jr, Augustan Reprint Society Publ. No. 54 (Los Angeles: William Andrews Clark Memorial Library, 1954)) details various revisions and cuts made to the text in the fourth, fifth, seventh, and eighth editions. Two of these changes are corrections of minor misprints (see 508.40, ‘her Diffidence’, which reads ‘his Diffidence’ in editions 2–5, and 509.15, ‘his Hands’, which reads ‘his Hand’ in editions 2–4), and these corrections have been observed in the text below. Internal page-references have been brought into conformity with the present edition.</p>
<h3 class="h2"><small class="calibre2">INTRODUCTION TO THIS SECOND EDITION</small></h3>
<p class="noindent"><em class="calibre6">THE kind Reception which this Piece has met with from the Publick, (a large Impression having been carried off in less than Three Months) deserves not only Acknowledgment, but that some Notice should be taken of the Objections that have hitherto come to hand against a few Passages in it, that so the Work may be rendered as unexceptionable as possible, and, of consequence, the fitter to answer the general Design of it; which is to promote Virtue, and cultivate the Minds of the Youth of both Sexes</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre6">But Difficulties having arisen from the different Opinions of Gentlemen, some of whom applauded the very Things that others found Fault with, it was thought proper to submit the Whole to the Judgment of a Gentleman of the most distinguish’d Taste and Abilities; the Result of which will be seen in the subsequent Pages</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_506"></a><em class="calibre6">We begin with the following Letter<a id="exp-note_114"></a><a href="part0021_split_114.html#exp-note-114" class="nounder">*</a> at the Desire of several Gentlemen, to whom, on a very particular Occasion, it was communicated, and who wish’d to see it prefixed to the New Edition. It was directed</em>,</p>
<h4 class="h3"><em class="calibre6">To the Editor of</em> P<small class="calibre2">AMELA</small>.</h4>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre6">Dear Sir</em>,</p>
<p class="noindent">You have agreeably deceiv’d me into a Surprize, which it will be as hard to express, as the Beauties of P<small class="calibre2">AMELA</small>. Though I open’d this powerful little Piece with more Expectation than from common Designs, of like Promise, because it came from <em class="calibre6">your</em> Hands, for my <em class="calibre6">Daughters<a id="exp-note_115"></a><a href="part0021_split_115.html#exp-note-115" class="nounder">*</a></em> yet, who could have dreamt, he should find, under the modest Disguise of a <em class="calibre6">Novel</em>, all the <em class="calibre6">Soul</em> of Religion, Good-breeding, Discretion, Good-nature, Wit, Fancy, Fine Thought, and Morality?—I have done nothing but read it to others, and hear others again read it, to me, ever since it came into my Hands; and I find I am likely to do nothing else, for I know not how long yet to come; because, if I lay the Book down, it comes after me.—When it has dwelt all Day long upon the Ear, It takes Possession, all Night, of the Fancy.—It has Witchcraft in every Page of it: but it is the Witchcraft of Passion and Meaning. Who is there that will not despise the false, empty <em class="calibre6">Pomp</em> of the Poets, when he observes in this little, unpretending, mild Triumph of <em class="calibre6">Nature</em>, the whole Force of Invention and Genius, creating new Powers of Emotion, and transplanting <em class="calibre6">Ideas</em> of <em class="calibre6">Pleasure</em> into that unweeded low Garden the <em class="calibre6">Heart</em>, from the dry and sharp <em class="calibre6">Summit</em> of <em class="calibre6">Reason?</em></p>
<p class="indent">Y<small class="calibre2">ET</small>, I confess, there is <em class="calibre6">One</em>, in the World, of whom I think with still greater Respect, than of P<small class="calibre2">AMELA</small>: and That is, of the wonderful AUTHOR of P<small class="calibre2">AMELA</small>.—Pray, Who is he, Dear Sir? and where, and how, has he been able to hide, hitherto, such an encircling and all-mastering Spirit? He possesses every Quality that A<small class="calibre2">RT</small> could have charm’d by: yet, has lent it to, and conceal’d it in, N<small class="calibre2">ATURE</small>.—The Comprehensiveness of his Imagination must be truly prodigious!—It has stretch’d out this diminutive mere <em class="calibre6">Grain</em> of <em class="calibre6">Mustard-seed</em>, (a poor Girl’s little, innocent, Story) into a Resemblance of That <em class="calibre6">Heaven<a id="exp-note_116"></a><a href="part0021_split_116.html#exp-note-116" class="nounder">*</a></em> which the Best of Good Books has compar’d it to.—All the Passions are His, in their most close and abstracted Recesses: and by selecting the most delicate, and yet, at the same time, most powerful, of their Springs, thereby to act, wind, and manage, the Heart, He <em class="calibre6">moves</em> us, every where, with the Force of a T<small class="calibre2">RAGEDY</small>.</p>
<p class="indent">W<small class="calibre2">HAT</small> is there, throughout the <em class="calibre6">Whole</em>, that I do not sincerely admire!—I admire, in it, the strong distinguish’d Variety, and picturesque glowing Likeness to <em class="calibre6">Life</em>, of the Characters. I know, hear, see, and live among ’em All: and, if I cou’d paint, cou’d return you their <em class="calibre6">Faces</em>. I admire, in it, the <a id="page_507"></a>noble Simplicity, Force, Aptness, and Truth, of so many modest, oeconomical, moral, prudential, religious, satirical, and cautionary, <em class="calibre6">Lessons;</em> which are introduc’d with such seasonable Dexterity, and with so polish’d and exquisite a Delicacy, of Expression and Sentiment, that I am only apprehensive, for the <em class="calibre6">Interests</em> of <em class="calibre6">Virtue</em>, lest some of the <em class="calibre6">finest</em>, and <em class="calibre6">most touching</em>, of those elegant Strokes of Good-breeding, Generosity, and Reflection, shou’d be lost, under the too gross Discernment of an unfeeling Majority of Readers; for whose Coarseness, however, they were kindly design’d, as the most useful and charitable Correctives.</p>
<p class="indent">O<small class="calibre2">NE</small> of the best-judg’d Peculiars, of the Plan, is, that These Instructions being convey’d, as in a Kind of Dramatical Representation, by those beautiful <em class="calibre6">Scenes</em>, Her own Letters and Journals, who acts the most moving and suffering <em class="calibre6">Part</em>, we feel the Force in a threefold Effect,—from the Motive, the Act, and the Consequence.</p>
<p class="indent">B<small class="calibre2">UT</small> what, above All, I am charm’d with, is the amiable <em class="calibre6">Good-nature</em> of the A<small class="calibre2">UTHOR</small>; who, I am convinc’d, has one of the best, and most generous Hearts, of Mankind: because, mis-measuring <em class="calibre6">other</em> Minds, by <em class="calibre6">His Own</em>, he can draw Every thing, to Perfection, but <em class="calibre6">Wickedness</em>.——I became inextricably in <em class="calibre6">Love</em> with this delightful Defect of his Malice;—for, I found it owing to an <em class="calibre6">Excess</em> in his <em class="calibre6">Honesty</em>. Only observe, Sir, with what <em class="calibre6">virtuous Reluctance</em> he complies with the Demands of his Story, when he stands in need of some blameable Characters. Tho’ his Judgment compels him to mark ’em with disagreeable Colourings, so that they make an odious Appearance at first, He can’t forbear, by an unexpected and gradual Decline from Themselves, to soften and transmute all the Horror conceiv’d for their Baseness, till we are arriv’d, through insensible Stages, at an Inclination to forgive it intirely.</p>
<p class="indent">I <small class="calibre2">MUST</small> venture to add, without mincing the matter, what I really believe, of this Book.—It will live on, through Posterity, with such unbounded Extent of Good Consequences, that Twenty Ages to come may be the Better and Wiser, for its Influence. It will steal first, imperceptibly, into the Hearts of the <em class="calibre6">Young</em> and the <em class="calibre6">Tender</em>: where It will afterwards guide and moderate their Reflections and Resolves, when grown Older. And so, a gradual moral Sunshine, of un-austere and compassionate <em class="calibre6">Virtue</em>, shall break out upon the <em class="calibre6">World</em>, from this T<small class="calibre2">RIFLE</small> (for such, I dare answer for the <em class="calibre6">Author</em>, His Modesty misguides him to think it).—No Applause therefore can be too <em class="calibre6">high</em>, for <em class="calibre6">such Merit</em>. And, let me abominate the contemptible <em class="calibre6">Reserves of mean-spirited Men</em>, who while they but <em class="calibre6">hesitate</em> their Esteem, with Restraint, can be fluent and uncheck’d in their <em class="calibre6">Envy</em>.—In an Age so deficient in Goodness, Every such Virtue, as That of this Author, is a salutary <em class="calibre6">Angel</em>, in <em class="calibre6">Sodom</em>. And <em class="calibre6">One</em> who cou’d stoop to conceal, a Delight he receives from the <em class="calibre6">Worthy</em>, <a id="page_508"></a>wou’d be equally capable of submitting to an Approbation of the <em class="calibre6">Praise</em> of the <em class="calibre6">Wicked</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">I <small class="calibre2">WAS</small> thinking, just now, as I return’d from a <em class="calibre6">Walk</em> in the <em class="calibre6">Snow</em>, on that <em class="calibre6">Old Roman Policy</em>, of Exemptions in Favour of Men, who had given a few, bodily, Children to the Republick.<a id="exp-note_117"></a><a href="part0021_split_117.html#exp-note-117" class="nounder">*</a>—What superior Distinction ought <em class="calibre6">our</em> Country to find (but that <em class="calibre6">Policy</em> and <em class="calibre6">We</em> are at Variance) for Reward of this <em class="calibre6">Father, of Millions of</em> M<small class="calibre2">INDS</small>, which are to owe new Formation to the future Effect of his Influence!</p>
<p class="indent">U<small class="calibre2">PON</small> the whole, as I never met with so pleasing, so honest, and so truly deserving a Book, I shou’d never have done, if I explain’d All my Reasons for admiring its Author.—If it is not a <em class="calibre6">Secret</em>, oblige me so far as to tell me his <em class="calibre6">Name</em>: for since I feel him the <em class="calibre6">Friend</em> of my Soul, it would be a Kind of Violation to retain him a <em class="calibre6">Stranger</em>.——I am not able to thank you enough, for this highly acceptable Present. And, as for my Daughters, They have taken into their Own Hands the Acknowledgment due from their Gratitude. I am,</p>

<p class="noindent">‘—No Sentiments which I have here, or in my last, express’d, of the sweet <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, being more than the bare Truth, which every Man must feel, who lends his Ear to the inchanting Prattler, why does the Author’s Modesty mislead his Judgment, to suspect the Style wants Polishing?—No, Sir, there is an <em class="calibre6">Ease</em>, a <em class="calibre6">natural Air</em>, a dignify’d <em class="calibre6">Simplicity</em>, and measured Fullness, in it, that, resembling Life, outglows it! He has reconciled the <em class="calibre6">Pleasing</em> to the <em class="calibre6">Proper</em>. The <em class="calibre6">Thought</em> is every-where exactly <em class="calibre6">cloath’d</em> by the <em class="calibre6">Expression</em>: And becomes its Dress as roundly, and as close, as <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> her Country-habit. Remember, tho’ she put it on with humble Prospect, of descending to the Level of her Purpose, it <em class="calibre6">adorn’d</em> her, with such unpresum’d <em class="calibre6">Increase</em> of Loveliness; sat with such neat Propriety of Elegant Neglect about her, that it threw out All her Charms, with tenfold, and resistless Influence.—And so, dear Sir, it will be always found.—When modest Beauty seeks to hide itself by casting off the <em class="calibre6">Pride</em> of <em class="calibre6">Ornament</em>, it but displays itself without a <em class="calibre6">Covering</em>: And so, becoming more distinguished, by its Want of <em class="calibre6">Drapery</em>, grows <em class="calibre6">stronger</em>, from its <em class="calibre6">purpos’d Weakness</em>’<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre6">There were formed by an anonymous Gentleman<a id="exp-note_119"></a><a href="part0021_split_119.html#exp-note-119" class="nounder">*</a> the following Objections to some Passages in the Work</em>.<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent">1. That the Style ought to be a little raised, at least so soon as <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> knows the Gentleman’s Love is honourable, and when her Diffidence is <a id="page_509"></a>changed to Ease: And from about the fourth Day after Marriage, it should be equal to the Rank she is rais’d to, and charged to fill becomingly.</p>
<p class="indent">2. That to avoid the Idea apt to be join’d with the Word’<em class="calibre6">Squire</em>, the Gentleman should be styled Sir <em class="calibre6">James</em>, or Sir <em class="calibre6">John</em>, &amp;c. and Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> in a new Edition might procure for him the Title of a Baronet.</p>
<p class="indent">3. That if the sacred Name were seldomer repeated, it would be better; for that the Wise Man’s Advice is, <em class="calibre6">Be not righteous over-much<a id="exp-note_120"></a><a href="part0021_split_120.html#exp-note-120" class="nounder">*</a></em></p>
<p class="indent">4. That the Penance which <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> suffers from Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em> might be shorten’d: That she is too timorous after owning her Marriage to that Lady, and ought to have a little more Spirit, and get away sooner out at the Window, or call her own Servants to protect, and carry her to her Husband’s Appointment.</p>
<p class="indent">5. That Females are too apt to be struck with Images of Beauty; and that the Passage where the Gentleman is said to span the Waist of <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> with his Hands, is enough to ruin a Nation of Women by Tight-lacing.</p>
<p class="indent">6. That the Word <em class="calibre6">naughty</em> had better be changed to some other, as <em class="calibre6">Bad, Faulty, Wicked, Vile, Abominable, Scandalous</em>: Which in most Places would give an Emphasis, for which recourse must otherwise be had to the innocent Simplicity of the Writer; an Idea not necessary to the Moral of the Story, nor of Advantage to the Character of the Heroine.</p>
<p class="indent">7. That the Words, <em class="calibre6">p</em>. 437. <em class="calibre6">Foolish Thing that I am</em>, had better be <em class="calibre6">Foolish that I am</em>. The same Gentleman observes by way of <em class="calibre6">Postscript</em>, that Jokes are often more severe, and do more Mischief, than more solid Objections; and would have one or two Passages alter’d, to avoid giving Occasion for the Supposition of a double Entendre, particularly in two Places which he mentions, <em class="calibre6">viz. p</em>. 345 <em class="calibre6">and</em> 349.<a id="exp-note_121"></a><a href="part0021_split_121.html#exp-note-121" class="nounder">*</a><br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre6">He is pleased to take notice of several other Things of less Moment, some of which are merely typographical; and very kindly expresses, on the Whole, a high Opinion of the Performance, and thinks it may do a great deal of Good: For all which, as well as for his Objections, the Editor gives him very sincere Thanks</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre6">Others are of Opinion, That the Scenes in many Places, in the Beginning especially, are too low; and that the Passions of Lady</em> Davers, <em class="calibre6">in particular, are carried too high, and above Nature</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre6">And others have intimated, That</em> Pamela <em class="calibre6">ought, for Example sake, to have discharg’d Mrs</em>. Jewkes <em class="calibre6">from her Service</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre6">These are the most material Objections that have come to hand, all which are considered in the following Extracts from some of the most beautiful Letters that have been written in any Language:<a id="exp-note_122"></a><a href="part0021_split_122.html#exp-note-122" class="nounder">*</a></em></p>
<p class="indent">‘The Gentleman’s Advice,<a id="exp-note_123"></a><a href="part0021_split_123.html#exp-note-123" class="nounder">*</a> not to alter <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> at all, was both friendly, and solidly just. I run in, with full Sail, to his Anchorage, that the low <a id="page_510"></a>Scenes are no more out of Nature, than the high Passions of proud Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>. Out of Nature, do they say? ’Tis my Astonishment how Men of Letters can read with such absent Attention! They are so far from <em class="calibre6">Out</em> of <em class="calibre6">Nature</em>, They are absolute <em class="calibre6">Nature herself!</em> or, if they must be confess’d her <em class="calibre6">Resemblance;</em> they are <em class="calibre6">such</em> a Resemblance, at least, as our <em class="calibre6">true Face</em> gives our <em class="calibre6">Face</em> in the <em class="calibre6">Looking-glass</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">‘I wonder indeed, what it is, that the Gentlemen, who talk of <em class="calibre6">Low</em> Scenes, wou’d desire should be understood by the Epithet?—Nothing, properly speaking, is <em class="calibre6">low</em>, that suits well with the Place it is rais’d to.——The Passions of Nature are the same, in the <em class="calibre6">Lord</em>, and his <em class="calibre6">Coach-man</em>. All, that makes them seem different consists in the <em class="calibre6">Degrees</em>, in the <em class="calibre6">Means</em>, and the <em class="calibre6">Air</em>, whereto or wherewith they indulge ’em. If, in painting Distinctions like these, (which arise but from the Forms of Men’s Manners, drawn from <em class="calibre6">Birth, Education</em>, and <em class="calibre6">Custom)</em> a Writer <em class="calibre6">falls short</em> of his Characters, there his Scene is a low one, indeed, whatever high Fortune it flatter’d. But, to imagine that Persons of Rank are above a Concern for what is thought, felt, or acted, by others, of their Species, between whom and themselves is <em class="calibre6">no Difference</em>, except such as was owing to Accident, is to reduce Human Nature to a Lowness,—<em class="calibre6">too low</em> for the <em class="calibre6">Truth</em> of her <em class="calibre6">Frailty</em>.—</p>
<p class="indent">‘In <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, in particular, we owe All to her <em class="calibre6">Lowness</em>. It is to the docile Effects of this Lowness of <em class="calibre6">that amiable Girl</em>, in her Birth, her Condition, her Hopes, and her Vanities, in every thing, in short, but her <em class="calibre6">Virtue</em>,—that her Readers are indebted, for the moral <em class="calibre6">Reward</em>, of that <em class="calibre6">Virtue</em>. And if we are to look for the <em class="calibre6">Low</em> among the Rest of the Servants, less lovely tho’ they are, than a <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, there is something however, so glowingly painted, in the Lines whereby the Author has mark’d their Distinctions——Something, so movingly forceful, in the <em class="calibre6">Grief at</em> their <em class="calibre6">Parting</em>, and <em class="calibre6">Joy</em> at the happy <em class="calibre6">Return</em>,—Something so finely, at once, and so strongly and feelingly, <em class="calibre6">varied</em>, even in the smallest and least promising, little Family Incidents! that I need only appeal from the <em class="calibre6">Heads</em>, to the <em class="calibre6">Hearts</em> of the Objectors themselves, whether these are <em class="calibre6">low</em> Scenes to be censur’d?</p>
<p class="indent">‘And as for the opposite Extreme they wou’d quarrel with, the highpassion’d, and un-tam’d Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>,—I cou’d direct ’em to a Dozen or two of <em class="calibre6">Quality Originals</em>, from whom (with Exception perhaps of her <em class="calibre6">Wit)</em> one wou’d swear the Author had taken her Copy.—What a Sum might these Objectors ensure, to be paid, by the <em class="calibre6">Husbands</em> and <em class="calibre6">Sons</em>, of such termagant, hermaphrodite Minds, upon their making due Proof, that they were no longer to be found, in the Kingdom!</p>
<p class="indent">‘I know, you are too just to imagine me capable of giving any other Opinion than my best-weigh’d and true one. But, because it is fit you should have <em class="calibre6">Reasons</em>, in Support of a Judgment that can neither deserve <a id="page_511"></a>nor expect an implicit Reception, I will run over the Anonymous Letter I herewith return you; and note with what Lightness even Men of <em class="calibre6">good-natur’d</em> Intention fall into <em class="calibre6">Mistakes</em>, by Neglect in too hasty Perusals, which their Benevolence wou’d take Pleasure in blushing at, when they discover their Weakness, in a cooler Revisal.</p>
<p class="indent">‘The Writer of this Letter is for having the Style <em class="calibre6">rats’d</em>, after <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>’s Advance in her Fortune. But surely, This was hasty Advice: because, as the Letters are writ to her Parents, it wou’d have look’d like forgetting, and, in some sort, insulting, the Lowliness of their inferior Condition, to have assum’d a new Air in her Language, in Place of retaining a steady Humility. But, here, it must not be pass’d unobserv’d, that in her Reports of Conversations that follow’d her Marriage, she <em class="calibre6">does</em>, aptly and beautifully, heighten her Style, and her Phrases: still returning however to her decent Simplicity, in her Addresses to her Father and Mother.</p>
<p class="indent">‘I am against giving a Gentleman (who has ennobled himself, by reforming his Vices, and rewarding the Worth of the <em class="calibre6">Friendless</em>) the unnecessary new Toy of a <em class="calibre6">Title</em>. It is all strong in Nature, as it stands in the Letters: and I don’t see how Greatness, from Titles, can add Likeness or Power, to the Passions. So complete a Resemblance of <em class="calibre6">Truth</em> stands in need of no borrow’d Pretensions.</p>
<p class="indent">‘The Only of this Writer’s Objections, which, I think, carries Weight, is That, which advises some little <em class="calibre6">Contraction</em> of the Prayers, and Appeals to the Deity. I say <em class="calibre6">little</em> Contraction: for they are nobly and sincerely pathetic. And I say it only in Fear, lest, if fansied too long, by the fashionably <em class="calibre6">Averse</em> to the Subject, Minds, which most want the <em class="calibre6">purpos’d Impression</em>, might hazard the <em class="calibre6">Loss</em> of its <em class="calibre6">Benefit</em>, by passing over those pious Reflections, which, if shorter, would catch their Attention.</p>
<p class="indent">‘Certainly, the Gentleman’s Objection against the Persecution that <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> suffers from Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers</em>, in respect to the Relation this Madwoman bears to the <em class="calibre6">Brother</em>, is the rashest of All his Advices! And when he thinks she ought rather to have assum’d the Protection of her Servants, he seems unaware of the probable <em class="calibre6">Consequence;</em> where there was a Puppy, of Quality, in the Case, who had, even without Provocation, drawn his Sword on the poor passive P<small class="calibre2">AMELA</small>. Far from bearing a Thought of exciting an abler Resentment, to the Danger of a Quarrel with so worthless a Coxcomb, how charmingly natural, apprehensive, and generous, is her Silence (during the Recital she makes of her Sufferings) with regard to this <em class="calibre6">masculine</em> Part of the Insult! as also her Prevention of Mrs. <em class="calibre6">Jewkes</em>’s less delicate Bluntness, when she was beginning to complain of the whelp Lord’s Impertinence!</p>
<p class="indent">‘If I were not afraid of a <em class="calibre6">Pun</em>, I shou’d tell the anonymous Letter-writer, that he made a too <em class="calibre6">tight-laced</em> Objection, where he quarrels with the <a id="page_512"></a>spann’d Waist of <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>. What, in the Name of Unshapeliness! cou’d he find, to complain of, in a beautiful Girl of Sixteen, who was born <em class="calibre6">out of Germany</em>, and had not, yet, reach’d ungraspable <em class="calibre6">Roundness!</em>——These are wonderful Sinkings from Purpose, where a Man is considering such mental, and passionate Beauties, as this Gentleman profess’d to be touch’d by!</p>
<p class="indent">‘But, when he goes on, to object against the Word <em class="calibre6">naughty</em>, (as apply’d in the Phrase <em class="calibre6">naughty Master)</em> I grow mortified, in Fear for our human Sufficiency, compar’d with our Aptness to blunder! For, here, ’tis plain, this Director of Another’s Discernment is quite blind, Himself, to an Elegance, one wou’d have thought it <em class="calibre6">impossible</em> not to be struck by?—Faulty, wicked, abominable, scandalous, (which are the angry Adjectives, he prefers to that sweet one) wou’d have carried Marks of her Rage, not Affliction—whereas <em class="calibre6">naughty</em> contains, in One single significant Petulance, twenty thousand inexpressible Delicacies!—It insinuates, at once, all the beautiful Struggle, between her Contempt of his Purpose, and tender Regard for his Person; her Gratitude to Himself and his Family; her Recollection of his superior Condition.—There is in the elegant Choice of this half-kind, half-peevish, <em class="calibre6">Word</em>, a never-enough to be prais’d speaking Picture of the Conflict betwixt her Disdain, and her Reverence! See, Sir, the Reason I had, for apprehending some Danger that the refin’d Generosity in many of the most charming of the Sentiments wou’d be <em class="calibre6">lost</em>, upon the too coarse Conception of some, for whose Use the Author intended them.</p>
<p class="indent">‘It is the same Case again, in <em class="calibre6">foolish Thing that I am!</em> which this nice, un-nice, Gentleman wou’d advise you to change, into <em class="calibre6">foolish that I am!</em> He does not seem to have tasted the pretty Contempt of Herself, the submissive <em class="calibre6">Diminutive</em>, so distant from Vanity, yet allay’d by the gentle Reluctance in Self-condemnation;—and the other fine Touches of Nature: which wou’d All have been lost, in the grave, sober Sound of his <em class="calibre6">Dutch Emendation<a id="exp-note_124"></a><a href="part0021_split_124.html#exp-note-124" class="nounder">*</a></em></p>
<p class="indent">‘As to his Paragraph in <em class="calibre6">Postscript</em>, I shall say the less of it, because the Gentleman’s own good Sense seems to confess, by the Place he has chosen to rank it in, that it ought to be turn’d out of Doors, as too <em class="calibre6">dirty</em> for the rest of his Letter.—In the Occasions he is pleas’d to discover for <em class="calibre6">Jokes</em>, I either find not, that he has any Signification at all, or such vulgar, coarse-tasted Allusions to loose low-life Idioms, that <em class="calibre6">not</em> to understand what he means, is both the cleanliest, and prudentest Way of confuting him.</p>
<p class="indent">‘And now, Sir, you will easily gather how far I am from thinking it needful to change any thing in <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>. I would not scratch such a beautiful Face, for the <em class="calibre6">Indies!</em></p>
<p class="indent">‘You can hardly imagine how it charms me to hear of a Second Edition already! but the News of still new upon new ones, will be found no Subject of Wonder.

<p class="indent">‘I am glad I made War, in my last, upon the Notion of altering the Style: for, having read it twice over since then, (and to Audiences, where the <em class="calibre6">Tears</em> were applausively eloquent) I could hardly, here and there, find a Place, where one Word <em class="calibre6">can</em> be chang’d for a better. There are some indeed, where ’twere <em class="calibre6">possible</em> to leave out, a few, without making a Breach in the Building.

<p class="indent"><em class="calibre6">The following delightful Story, so admirably related, will give great Pleasure to the Reader; and we take the Liberty of inserting it, for that very Reason</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">‘What a never-to-be satisfied <em class="calibre6">Length</em> has this Subject always the Power <a id="page_515"></a>of attracting me into! And yet, before I have done, I must by your means tell the Author a <em class="calibre6">Story</em>, which a Judge not so skilful in Nature as he is, might be in Danger perhaps of mistaking, for a trifling and silly one. I expect it shou’d give him the clearest Conviction, in a Case he is subject to question.</p>
<p class="indent">‘We have a lively little Boy in the Family, about seven Years old—but, alas for him, poor Child! quite unfriended; and born to no Prospect.<a id="exp-note_129"></a><a href="part0021_split_129.html#exp-note-129" class="nounder">*</a> He is the Son of an honest, poor Soldier, by a Wife, grave, unmeaning, and innocent. Yet the Boy, (see the Power of connubial <em class="calibre6">Simplicity)</em> is so pretty, so genteel, and gay-spirited, that we have made him, and design’d him, our <em class="calibre6">own</em>, ever since he could totter, and waddle. The wanton Rogue is half Air: and every Motion he acts by has a Spring, like <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>’s when she threw down the Card-table. All this Quickness, however, is temper’d by a good-natur’d Modesty: so that the wildest of his Flights are thought rather diverting than troublesome. He is an hourly Foundation for Laughter, from the Top of the House to the Parlours: and, to borrow an Attribute from the Reverend Mr. <em class="calibre6">Peters</em>, (tho’ without any Note of his Musick) <em class="calibre6">plays a very good</em> F<small class="calibre2">IDDLE</small> in the Family. I have told you the History of this <em class="calibre6">Tom-tit</em> of a Prater, because, ever since my first reading of P<small class="calibre2">AMELA</small>, he puts in for a Right to be <em class="calibre6">one</em> of her Hearers; and, having got half her Sayings by heart, talks in no other Language but hers: and, what really surprises, and has charm’d me into a <em class="calibre6">certain</em> Fore-taste of her Influence, he is, at once, become fond of his Book; which (before) he cou’d never be brought to attend to—that <em class="calibre6">he may read</em> P<small class="calibre2">AMELA</small>, he says, <em class="calibre6">without stopping</em>. The first Discovery we made of this Power over so unripe and unfix’d an Attention, was, one Evening, when I was reading her Reflections at the <em class="calibre6">Pond</em> to some Company. The little rampant Intruder, being kept out by the Extent of the Circle, had crept under my Chair, and was sitting before me, on the Carpet, with his Head almost touching the Book, and his Face bowing down toward the Fire.—He had sat for some time in this Posture, with a Stillness, that made us conclude him asleep: when, on a sudden, we heard a Succession of heart-heaving Sobs; which while he strove to conceal from our Notice, his little Sides swell’d, as if they wou’d burst, with the throbbing Restraint of his Sorrow. I turn’d his innocent Face, to look toward me; but his Eyes were quite lost, in his <em class="calibre6">Tears</em>: which running down from his Cheeks in free Currents, had form’d two sincere little Fountains, on that Part of the Carpet he hung over. All the Ladies in Company were ready to devour him with Kisses: and he has, since, become doubly a Favourite—and is perhaps the youngest of <em class="calibre6">Pamela’s Converts</em>.</p>
<p class="blockquote1"><em class="calibre6">The same incomparable Writer has favour’d us with an Objection, that is more material than any we have mention’d; which cannot be better stated nor answer’d, than in his own beautiful Words; viz</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_516"></a>’An Objection is come into my Thoughts, which I should be glad the Author would think proper to obviate in the Front of the Second Edition.</p>
<p class="indent">‘There are Mothers, or Grandmothers, in all Families of affluent Fortune, who, tho’ they may have none of Lady <em class="calibre6">Davers’s Insolence</em>, will be apt to feel one of her <em class="calibre6">Fears</em>,—that the Example of a Gentleman so amiable as Mr. <em class="calibre6">B</em>—may be follow’d, by the <em class="calibre6">Jackies, their Sons</em>, with too blind and unreflecting a Readiness. Nor does the Answer of that Gentleman to his sister’s Reproach come quite up to the Point they will rest on. For, tho’ indeed it is true, all the World wou’d acquit the best Gentleman in it, if he married <em class="calibre6">such</em> a Waiting-maid as <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>, yet, there is an ill-discerning Partiality, in Passion, that will overthrow all the Force of that Argument: because <em class="calibre6">every belov’d Maid will be</em> P<small class="calibre2">AMELA</small>, in a Judgment obscur’d by her Influence.</p>
<p class="indent">‘And, since the Ground of this Fear will <em class="calibre6">seem</em> solid, I don’t know how to be easy, till it is shewn (nor ought it to be left to the Author’s Modesty) that they who consider his Design in that Light will be found but short-sighted Observers.</p>
<p class="indent">‘Request it of him then to suffer it to be told them, that not a limited, but general, Excitement to Virtue was the first and great End to his Story: And that this Excitement must have been deficient, and very imperfectly offer’d, if he had not look’d quite <em class="calibre6">as low as he cou’d</em> for his Example: because if there had been any Degree or Condition, more remote from the Prospect than that which he had chosen to work on, that Degree might have seem’d out of Reach of the Hope, which it was his generous Purpose to encourage.—And, so, he was under an evident <em class="calibre6">Necessity</em> to find such a Jewel in a <em class="calibre6">Cottage</em>: and expos’d, too, as she was, to the severest Distresses of Fortune, with Parents unable to support their own Lives, but from the daily hard Product of <em class="calibre6">Labour</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">‘Nor wou’d it have been sufficient to have plac’d her thus <em class="calibre6">low</em> and <em class="calibre6">distressful</em>, if he had not also suppos’d her a <em class="calibre6">Servant</em>: and that too in some elegant Family; for if she had always remain’d a Fellow-cottager with her Father, it must have carried an Air of Romantick Improbability to account for her polite Education.</p>
<p class="indent">‘If she had <em class="calibre6">wanted</em> those Improvements, which she found means to acquire in her <em class="calibre6">Service</em>, it wou’d have been very unlikely, that she shou’d have succeeded so well; and had destroy’d <em class="calibre6">one</em> great <em class="calibre6">Use</em> of the Story, to have allow’d such uncommon Felicity to the Effect of mere <em class="calibre6">personal Beauty</em>.—And it had not been <em class="calibre6">judicious</em> to have represented her as educated in a superior Condition of Life with the proper Accomplishments, before she became reduc’d by Misfortunes, and so not a Servant, but rather an Orphan under hopeless Distresses—because Opportunities which had made it no Wonder how she came to be so winningly qualified, <a id="page_517"></a>wou’d have lessen’d her Merit in being so. And besides, where had then been the purpos’d Excitement of Persons in P<small class="calibre2">AMELA’S</small> Condition of Life, by an Emulation of her Sweetness, Humility, Modesty, Patience, and Industry, to attain some faint Hope of arriving, in time, within View of <em class="calibre6">her</em> Happiness?——And what a delightful Reformation shou’d we see, in all Families, where the Vanity of their <em class="calibre6">Maids</em> took no Turn toward Ambition to <em class="calibre6">please</em>, but by such innocent Measures, as P<small class="calibre2">AMELA’S</small>!</p>
<p class="indent">‘As it is clear, then, the Author was under a Necessity to suppose her a <em class="calibre6">Servant</em>, he is not to be accountable for mistaken Impressions, which the Charms he has given her may happen to make, on wrong Heads, or weak Hearts, tho’ in Favour of Maids the Reverse of her Likeness.</p>
<p class="indent">‘What is it then (they may say) that the Lowness, and Distance of <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>’s Condition from the Gentleman’s who married her, proposes to teach the <em class="calibre6">Gay World</em>, and the <em class="calibre6">Fortunate?</em>—<em class="calibre6">It is this</em>—By Comparison with that infinite Remoteness of her Condition from the Reward which her Virtue procur’d her, one great <em class="calibre6">Proof</em> is deriv’d, (which is Part of the <em class="calibre6">Moral</em> of P<small class="calibre2">AMELA</small>) that Advantages from <em class="calibre6">Birth</em>, and Distinction of <em class="calibre6">Fortune</em>, have no Power at all, when consider’d against those from <em class="calibre6">Behaviour</em>, and Temper of <em class="calibre6">Mind</em>: because where the <em class="calibre6">Last</em> are <em class="calibre6">not added</em>, all the <em class="calibre6">First</em> will be boasted in vain. Whereas she who possesses the Last finds <em class="calibre6">no Want</em> of the First, in her Influence.</p>
<p class="indent">‘In <em class="calibre6">that</em> Light alone let the Ladies of <em class="calibre6">Rank</em> look at P<small class="calibre2">AMELA</small>.—Such an alarming Reflection as that will, at the same time that it raises the Hope and Ambition of the <em class="calibre6">Humble</em>, correct and mortify the Disdain of the <em class="calibre6">Proud</em>. For it will compel them to observe, and acknowledge, that ’tis the Turn of their <em class="calibre6">Mind</em>, not the Claims of their <em class="calibre6">Quality</em>, by which (and which only) Womens Charms can be lasting: And that, while the <em class="calibre6">haughty Expectations</em>, inseparable from an elevated Rank, serve but to multiply its Complaints and Afflictions, the Condescensions of <em class="calibre6">accomplish’d Humility</em>, attracting Pity, Affection, and Reverence, secure an hourly Increase of Felicity.—So that the <em class="calibre6">moral Meaning</em> of P<small class="calibre2">AMELA</small>’S Good-fortune, far from tempting young Gentlemen to marry <em class="calibre6">such</em> Maids as are found in their Families, is, by teaching Maids <em class="calibre6">to deserve to be Mistresses</em>, to stir up Mistresses <em class="calibre6">to support their Distinction</em>’<br class="calibre3"/><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="indent"><em class="calibre6">We shall only add, That it was intended to prefix two neat</em> Frontispieces <em class="calibre6">to this Edition, (and to present them to the Purchasers of the first) and one was actually finished for that Purpose;<a id="exp-note_130"></a><a href="part0021_split_130.html#exp-note-130" class="nounder">*</a> but there not being Time for the other, from the Demand for the new Impression; and the Engraving Part of that which was done (tho’ no Expence was spared) having fallen very short of the Spirit of the Passages they were intended to represent, the Proprietors were advised to lay them aside.
