<p class="blockquote4">Four Aesopian fables are recalled in <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> (see above, pp. 76, 77, 185, 443), and in later editions of the novel Richardson added a note to the first of these, referring readers to ‘the <em class="calibre6">Aesop</em>’s Fables, sold by <em class="calibre6">J. Osborn</em>, in <em class="calibre6">Pater-noster Row</em>, which has lately been selected and reform’d from those of Sir <em class="calibre6">R. L’Estrange</em>, and the most eminent Mythologists’ (5th edn. (Sept. 1741), i. 93). Similar notes are in the continuation of December 1741, where Pamela recalls a further fable (‘A Cat and Venus’), and in the octavo sixth edition of 1742.</p>
<p class="blockquote5">The work in question, which Richardson acknowledged as his own in a letter to Johannes Stinstra of 2 June 1753, had originally been published on 20 November 1739, only ten days after he began writing <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>. Its guarded (though in fact far from neutral) treatment of L’Estrange’s politically charged original of 1692 is indicated by its full title: ‘<em class="calibre6">Æsop’s Fables. With Instructive Morals and Reflections, Abstracted from All Party Considerations, Adapted to All Capacities; and Designed to Promote Religion, Morality, and Universal Benevolence</em>’ Minor adjustments are made to L’Estrange’s wording, along with major excisions, the result being that a convenient ambiguity inhibits exact identification of <em class="calibre6">Pamela’s</em>, source. The internal logic of the novel (which appears to be set some years before publication) invites us to assume that Pamela has been reading L’Estrange’s original, a lavish folio she may well be supposed to have found ‘in my Lady’s Books’ (p. 76). However, her rendering of ‘An Ant and a Grass-hopper’ in fact follows the minor rewordings of Richardson’s much humbler production (a children’s book in format, with illustrative woodcuts). Richardson was quite accurate, then, when using newspaper advertisements to unload remaining stock of his own edition as ‘the Æsop quoted in Pamela’ (see e.g. <em class="calibre6">Daily Post</em>, 14 Dec. 1742).</p>
<p class="blockquote5">The fables concerned are reprinted here from the Bodleian Library copy of the rare first edition of 1739. A later edition (undated, but apparently <em class="calibre6">c</em>.1775) is reprinted as the second volume of Garland Publishing’s facsimile series <em class="calibre6">Richardsoniana</em> (New York, 1974–5).</p>

<p class="noindent">A Country Mouse invited a City Sister of her’s to a Collation, where she spar’d for nothing that the Place afforded; as mouldy Crusts, <a id="page_521"></a>Cheese-Parings, musty Oatmeal, rusty Bacon, and the like. The City Dame was too well bred to find Fault with her Entertainment; but yet represented, that such a Life was unworthy of a Merit like her’s; and letting her know how splendidly she liv’d, invited her to accompany her to Town. The Country Mouse consented, and away they trudg’d together, and about Midnight got to their Journey’s End. The City Mouse shewed her Friend the Larder, the Pantry, the Kitchen, and other Offices where she laid her Stores; and after this, carried her into the Parlour, where they found, yet upon the Table, the Reliques of a mighty Entertainment of that very Night. The City Mouse carv’d her Companion of what she liked best, and so to it they fell upon a Velvet Couch. The Country Mouse, who had never seen nor heard of such Doings before, bless’d herself at the Change of her Condition; when, as ill Luck would have it, all on a sudden the Doors flew open, and in comes a Crew of noisy Servants of both Sexes, to feast upon the Dainties that were left. This put the poor Mice to their Wit’s End how to save their Skins; the Stranger especially, who had never been in such Danger before: but she made a Shift however for the present to slink into a Corner, where she lay trembling and panting till the Company went away. As soon as ever the House was quiet again; Well! my Court Sister, says she, if this be the Sauce to your rich Meats, I’ll e’en back to my Cottage, and my mouldy Cheese again; for I had much rather lie knabbing of Crusts, without Fear or Hazard, in my own Hole, than be Mistress of all the Delicates in the World, and subject to such terrifying Alarms and Dangers.</p>

<p class="hangingpara"><em class="calibre6">This Fable shews the Difference between a Court and a Country Life: The Delights, Innocence, and Security of the one, compar’d with the Anxiety, Voluptuousness and Hazards of the other</em>.</p>
<h5 class="h4">R<small class="calibre2">EFLECTION</small>.</h5>
<p class="indent">How infinitely superior are the Delights of a private Life to the Noise and Bustle of a public one! Innocence, Security, Meditation, good Air, Health and unbroken Rest, are the Blessings of the one; while the Rages of Lust and Wine, Noise, Hurry, Circumvention, Falsehood, Treachery, Confusion, and ill Health are the constant Attendants of the other.</p>
<p class="indent">The Splendor and the Luxury of a Court are but a poor Recompence for the slavish Attendances, the invidious Competitions, and the mortal Disappointments that accompany it. The uncertain Favour of Princes, and the Envy of those who judge by Hearsay or Appearance, without either Reason or Truth, make even the best Sort of Court Lives miserable. To say nothing of the innumerable Temptations, Vices and Excesses of a Life of Pomp and Pleasure. Let a Man but set the pleasing of his Palate <a id="page_522"></a>against the Surfeits of Gluttony and Excess; the starving of his Mind against a pamper’d Carcase; the restless Importunities of Tale-bearers and Back-friends against fair Words and Professions only from the Teeth outwards: let him, I say, but set the one in Balance against the other, and he shall find himself miserable, even in the very Height of his Delights. To say all in a Word; Let him but set the Comforts of a Life spent in Noise, Formality and Tumult, against the Blessings of a Retreat with Competency and Freedom, and then cast up his Account.</p>
<p class="indent">What Man then, that is not stark mad, will voluntarily expose himself to the imperious Brow-beatings and Scorns of great Men! To have a Dagger struck to his Heart in an Embrace! To be torn to Pieces by Calumny; nay, to be a Knave in his own Defence! For the Honester the more dangerous in a vicious Age, and where ’tis a Crime not to be like the Company. Men of that Character are not to be read and understood by their Words, but by their Interests; their Promises and Protestations are no longer binding than while they are profitable to them.</p>
<p class="indent">After all, to keep the Fable more closely in View, let a Man, with the Country Mouse, reflect on the Peace and Safety of a rural Retirement, and prefer, if he can, the Insecurity, Noise and Hurry of a more exalted Fortune.</p>

<p class="noindent">A Dog brought an Action of the Case against a Sheep, for some certain Measures of Wheat, that he had lent him. The Plaintiff proved the Debt by three positive Witnesses, the Wolf, the Kite, and the Vulture. The Defendant was cast in Costs and Damages, and forc’d to sell the Wool from his Back to satisfy the Creditor.</p>

<p class="hangingpara"><em class="calibre6">It is not a Straw Matter, whether the main Cause be right or wrong, or the Charge true or false, where the Bench, Jury and Witnesses are in a Conspiracy against the Prisoner</em>.</p>
<h5 class="h4">R<small class="calibre2">EFLECTION</small>.</h5>
<p class="indent">No Innocence can be safe, where Power and Malice are in Confederacy against it. There is no Fence against Subornation and false Evidence. There is no living, however, without Law; and there is no Help for it in many Cases, if the <em class="calibre6">saving Equity</em> be over-ruled by the <em class="calibre6">killing Letter</em> of it. It is the Verdict that does the Business, but it is the Evidence, true or false, that governs the Verdict. The only Danger is the giving too much Credit to the Oaths of Wolves, Kites and Vultures; that is to say, of Witnesses so profligate as to bring a Scandal even upon Truth itself.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><a id="page_523"></a>F<small class="calibre2">AB</small>. 163. <em class="calibre6">An</em> O<small class="calibre2">AK</small> <em class="calibre6">and a</em> W<small class="calibre2">ILLOW</small>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">I<small class="calibre2">N</small> a Controversy betwixt an Oak and a Willow, the Oak upbraided the Willow, that it was weak and wavering, and gave way to every Blast; while he scorn’d, he said, to bend to the most raging Tempests, which he despis’d as they whistled by him. Some very little while after this Dispute, it blew a most violent Storm. The Willow ply’d and gave way to the Gust, and still recover’d it self again, without receiving any Damage: But the Oak, stubbornly resisting the Hurricane, was torn up by the Roots.</p>
<h5 class="h4">M<small class="calibre2">ORMAL</small>.</h5>
<p class="hangingpara"><em class="calibre6">A stiff and a stubborn Obstinacy is not so much Firmness and Resolution, as Wilfulness. A wise Man will yield to the Necessity of his Affairs, and of the Times, in all honest Cases, rather than expose himself and Family to inevitable Ruin</em>.</p>
<h5 class="h4">R<small class="calibre2">EFLECTION</small>.</h5>
<p class="indent">There are many Cases, and many Seasons, wherein Men must either bend or break: But Conscience, Honour, and good Manners are first to be consulted. When a Tree is pressed with a strong Wind, the Branches may yield, and yet the Root remain firm. But Discretion is to govern us, where and when we may be allowed to temporize, and where and when not. When bending or breaking is the Question, and Men have no other Choice before them, than either of complying, or of being undone; it is no easy Matter to distinguish, Where, When, How, or To what Degree, to yield to the Importunity of the Occasion, or the Difficulty of the Times. The first Point, however, to be preserved sacred, and from whence a Man is never to depart, though for the saving of his Life, Liberty, popular Credit, or Estate, is <em class="calibre6">Conscience</em>. There are Trials of Men, as well as Trials of Trees: The Iniquity of the Age, or Conjuncture, is to the one, what Storms or Inundations are to the other. Now it is not Courage, but Obstinacy, in such as will rather choose to break than bend; where a yielding may be made with a good Conscience. For Men may be stiff and obstinate upon a wrong Ground, as well as they may ply and truckle upon a false Foundation. Our Bodies may be forced, but our Minds cannot: So that human Frailty is no Excuse for a criminal Immorality. For where the Law of God and Nature obliges me, the Plea of human Frailty can never discharge me. There is as much Difference betwixt bending and sinking, as there is betwixt breaking and bending. There must be no contending with insuperable Powers on the one hand, and no departing from indispensable Duties on the other: Nor is it the Part, either of a Christian, or of a Man, to abandon his Post. Now the just Medium of this Case lies between the Pride and the Abjectness of the two Extremes. As the Willow, for Instance, bends and recovers; while the stubborn and inflexible Oak is torn up by the Roots.</p>
<h4 class="h3"><a id="page_524"></a>F<small class="calibre2">AB</small>. 164. <em class="calibre6">An</em> A<small class="calibre2">NT</small> <em class="calibre6">and a</em> G<small class="calibre2">RASS-HOPPER</small>.</h4>
<p class="noindent">As the Ants were airing their Provisions one Winter, a hungry Grasshopper begg’d a Charity of them. They told him, that he should have wrought in Summer, if he would not have wanted in Winter. Well, says the Grass-hopper, but I was not idle neither; for I sung out the whole Season. Nay then, said they, you’ll e’en do well to make a merry Year of it, and dance in Winter to the Tune that you sung in Summer.</p>
<h5 class="h4">M<small class="calibre2">ORAL</small>.</h5>
<p class="hangingpara"><em class="calibre6">Action and Industry is the Business of a wise and a good Man, and nothing is so much to be despised as Slothfulness</em>. Go to the Ant, thou Sluggard, <em class="calibre6">says the Royal Preacher</em>, consider her Ways, and be wise;<a id="exp-note_134"></a><a href="part0021_split_134.html#exp-note-134" class="nounder">*</a> <em class="calibre6">which in few Words sums up the Moral of this Fable</em>.</p>
<h5 class="h4">R<small class="calibre2">EFLECTION</small>.</h5>
<p class="indent">It is hard to say of Laziness or Luxury, whether it be the more scandalous, or the more dangerous Evil. The very Soul of the Slothful does but lie drowzing in his Body, and the whole Man is totally given up to his Senses; whereas the Profit and the Comfort of Industry are substantial, firm and lasting; the Blessings of Security and Plenty go along with it, and it is never out of Season. What is the Grass-hopper’s Entertainment now, but a Summer’s Song? A vain, and an empty Pleasure? Let it be understood however, that we are not to pass Avarice upon the World under the Title of Good-husbandry and Thrift; and thereby utterly to extinguish Charity. We are indeed in the first Place to consult our own Necessities; but we are then to consider, in the second, that the Necessities of our Neighbours have a Christian Right to a Part of what we have to spare.</p>
<p class="indent">The Stress of this Moral lies upon the Preference of honest Labour to Idleness; and the Refusal of Relief on the one Hand, is intended only for a Reproof to the inconsiderate Loss of Opportunity on the other. This does not hinder yet, but that the Ants, out of their Abundance, ought to have reliev’d the Grass-hopper in her Distress, though it was her own Fault that brought her to it: For if one Man’s <em class="calibre6">Faults</em> could discharge another Man of his <em class="calibre6">Duty</em>, there would be no longer any Place left for the common Offices of Society. To conclude, We have our Failings, every one of us; and the Improvidence of my Neighbour must not make me inhuman. The Ant did well to reprove the Grass-hopper for her Slothfulness; but she did ill, after that, to refuse her a Charity in her Distress.</p>
