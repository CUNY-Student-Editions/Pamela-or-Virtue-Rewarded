<p class="noindent"><a id="exp-note-20"></a><a href="part0014_split_001.html#exp-note_20" class="nounder">a good Bishop that was to be burnt for his Religion</a>: Sabor notes that Pamela has probably been reading Foxe’s <em class="calibre6">Book of Martyrs</em> (1563), and points to the case of Thomas Bilney (burned at Norwich in 1531) who ‘would many times attempt to prove the fire with holding his finger nigh to the <a id="page_528"></a>candle; but especially the night before he suffered martyrdom, at which time … he burnt off the first joint; giving thanks to God for his strength’. Bilney was not a bishop, and Pamela may also have in mind Archbishop Cranmer’s famous mortification, in 1556, of the hand with which he had signed a recantation: ‘when the wood was kindled, and the fire began to burn near him, stretching out his arm, he put his right hand into the flame, which he held so steadfast and immovable … that all men might see his hand burned before his body was touched’ (<em class="calibre6">The Acts and Monuments of John Foxe</em>, ed. J. Pratt, 4th edn. (1877), iv. 653 n.; viii. 90). Cf. also <em class="calibre6">Clarissa</em>, 1098 (recalling Sir Thomas More’s words at the scaffold in 1535).</p>
