<p class="noindent"><a id="exp-note-40"></a><a href="part0015_split_001.html#exp-note_40" class="nounder">the dreadful Stake, and the Highway Interment</a>: referring to the ancient custom of burying the corpses of suicides at a crossroads, pierced with a wooden stake (thus symbolically protecting the community from restless or malevolent ghosts). Sabor quotes Horace Walpole’s allusion in 1788 to the ‘absurd stake and highway of our ancestors’, and though ritual burials persisted to this and later dates, they were increasingly confined to aggravated cases. In a recent case of suicide by a couple whose child was also found dead, ‘the Man was adjudged guilty of Murder and Suicide, and his Body buried in the High-way accordingly; but the Woman being supposed to hang herself at the Command of her Husband, was exempted from further Mischief’ (Sarah Chapone, <em class="calibre6">The Hardships of the English Laws in Relation to Wives</em> (1735), 25).</p>
