(See <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>’s continuation of 1741 for explicit play on the coincidence of names (iii. 141; iv. 116; iv. 165); also, for other aspects of the relationship, G. Beer, ‘<em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>: Rethinking <em class="calibre6">Arcadia</em>’, in M. A. Doody and P. Sabor (eds.), <em class="calibre6">Samuel Richardson: Tercentenary Essays</em> (1989), 23–39.) Among Philoclea’s arguments is the point that one should never lose faith in the continuing possibility of divine interposition, ‘since it is not for us to appoint that mighty majesty what time he will help us. The uttermost instant is scope enough for him to revoke everything to one’s own desire’ (<em class="calibre6">The Countess of Pembroke’s Arcadia (The Old Arcadia)</em>, ed. J. Robertson (1973), 297). This passage (from bk. iv of the <em class="calibre6">Old Arcadia)</em> was included in published editions of the <em class="calibre6">Arcadia</em> from 1593 onwards, including the version in the fourteenth edition of Sidney’s <em class="calibre6">Works</em> (1724–5), which SR partly printed (Sale, 204).</p>
