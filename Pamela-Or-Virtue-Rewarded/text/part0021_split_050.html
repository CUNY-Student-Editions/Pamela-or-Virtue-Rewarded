But Curius returned them againe with their gold, and told them, that such as were contented with that supper, had no nede of gold nor silver’ (<em class="calibre6">Plutarch’s Lives … Englished by Sir Thomas North</em>, ed. W. E. Henley (1895–6), iii. 3–4 (Life of Cato the Censor)). The same story (with lentils again, not roots) is recalled in <em class="calibre6">Clarissa</em>, 108.</p>
