<p class="noindent"><a id="exp-note-65"></a><a href="part0016_split_001.html#exp-note_65" class="nounder">GO, happy Paper … should be Night</a>: by Aaron Hill (1685–1750). A revised version of the poem, entitled ‘The Messenger’, is in Hill’s <em class="calibre6">Works</em> (1753), iii. 155–6, and its inclusion here may explain why at least one early reader, David Mallet, suspected that <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> had been written or co-written by Hill (Hill to Mallet, 23 Jan. 1741, Hill’s <em class="calibre6">Works</em> (1753), ii. 221). Hill’s own initial professions of ignorance about <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em>’s authorship (see above, <a href="part0019.html#appendix1" class="nounder">Appendix 1</a>, pp. 506, 508) may indicate that SR’s use of the poem in the first edition was unauthorized. The manuscript index to his <em class="calibre6">Pamela</em> correspondence records, however, that Hill later supplied him with copies of ‘The Messenger’, ‘Lesbia in the Garden’ (see below, n. to p. 495), and four other poems (one of which, ‘The Misgrounded Compassion’ appears in the continuation of 1741), ‘being the proposed Amendments of some of ye Verses in Pamela’. These copies, now lost, probably accompanied Hill’s letter to SR of 15 Dec. 1741 ‘on strengthening Pamela’s poetry’ (P. Sabor, ‘Richardson’s Index to His Correspondence on <em class="calibre6">Pamela’, Notes &amp; Queries</em>, <small class="calibre2">NS</small> 26 (1979), 556–60 (at pp. 559, 560)).</p>
