		<h1 class="title small-caps">Fab. 164	Ants and a Grasshopper.</h1>
			<p class="first"><span class="first-word">As</span> the ants were airing their provisions one winter, a hungry grasshopper begged a charity of them. They told him, the he should have wrought in summer, if he would not have wanted in winter. Well, says the grasshopper, but I was not idle neither: for I sung out the whole season. Nay then, said they, you will e’en do well to make a merry year of it, and dance in winter to the tune that you sung in the summer.</p>
		<h2 class="small-caps">Moral</h2>
			<p class="first italics">Action and industry is the business of a wife and good man, and nothing is so much to be despised as slothbusiness. <strong>Go to the ant, thou sluggard!</strong> Says the royal Preacher, <strong>confider her ways, and be wife</strong>; which in a few words sums up the moral of this fable.</p>
		<h2 class="small caps">Reflection</h2>
			<p class="first">It is hard to say of laziness of luxury, whether it be the more scandalous, or the more dangerous evil. the very soul of the slothful does but lie drowzing in his body, and the whole man is totally given up to his senses; whereas the profit and comfort of industry are substantial, firm and lasting; the blessings of secruity and plenty go along with it, and it is never out of season. What is the grasshopper’s entertainment now, but a summer’s song? A vain and empty pleasure? Let it be understood, however, that we are not to pass avarice upon the world, under the title of good-husbandry and thrift, and thereby utterly to extinguish charity. We are indeed in the first place to consult our own ncecessities; but we are then to consider, in the second that the necessities of our neighbours, have a Christian right to a part of what we have to spare.</p>
			<p>The stress of this moral lies upon the preference of honest labour to idleness; and the refusal of relief on the one hand, is intended only for a reproof to the onconsiderate loss of opporunity on the other. This does nothinder yet, but that the ants, out of their abundance, ought to have relieved the grasshopper in her distress, though it was her own fault that brought her to it: For if one man’s faults could sicharge another man of his duty, there would be nolonger any place left for the common offices of society. To conclude, We have our failings every one of us; and the improvidence of my neighbour must not make me inhuman. The ant did well to reprove the grasshopper for her slothfulness; but she did ill, after that, to refuse her a chairty in her duties.</p>

		<p class="first"><span class="first-word">As</span> the <strong>Ants</strong> were airing their Provisions one Winter, up comes a hungrey <strong>Grasshopper</strong> to ’em, and begs a Charity.

		<h2 class="small-caps">The Moral</h2>
		<p class="italics centered">A Life of Sloth is the Life of a Brute; but Action and Industry is the Bus’ness of a Great, a Wife, and a Good Man.</p>
		<h2 class="small-caps">Reflection</h2>
		<p class="first"><span class="first-word">Here</span>’s a Reproof to Men of Sensuality, and Pleasure. The Moral preachs Industry, and beats down Sloth; and shews that After-wit is nothing worth. It must be an Industrious Youth that provides against the Inconveniencies and Neccessities of old Age; and he that fools away the one, must either beg of starve in the other. <strong>Go to the Ant, thou sluggard, (says the Wife Man;)</strong> which in few Words sums up the Moral of this Fable. ’Tis hard to say of Laziness, or Luxury, whether it be the more scandalous, or the more dangerous Evil. The very Soul of the Slothful does effectually but lie drowzing in his Body, and the whole Man is totally given up to his Senses; whereas the Profit and the Comfort of Industry, is substantial, firm and lasting; the Blessings of Security and Penty go along with it, and it is never out of Season. What’s the <strong>Grasshopper’s</strong> Entertainment now, but a Summer’s song? A vain, and empty Pleasure? Let it be understood however, that we are not to pass <strong>Avarice</strong> upon the World under the Title of <strong>Good-Husbandry</strong> and <strong>Thrift</strong>; and under that Cover to extinguish <strong>Charity</strong>, by not distributing the Fruits of it. We are in the firsty Place to consult our own Necessities, but we are then to consider in the second Place, that the Necessities of our Neighbours have a Christian Right to a Part of what we have to spare. For the common Offices of Humanity, are as much Duties of <strong>Self-preservation</strong>, as what every <strong>Individual</strong> contributes to its own Well-being. It is, in short, the great Interest and Obligation of <strong>Particulars</strong>, to advance the Good of the <strong>Community</strong>.</p>
		<p>The Stress of this Moral lies upon the Preference of honest Labour to Idleness; and the Refusal of Relief on the one Hand, is intended only for Reproof to the Inconsiderate Loss of Opportunity on the other. This does not hinder yet, but that the <strong>Ants</strong>, out of their abundance, ought to have Reliev'd the <strong>Grasshopper</strong> in her Distress, though ’twas her own Fault that brough her to’t: for if one Man’s Faults could discharge another Man of his Duty, there would be no longer any Place left for the common Offices of Society. To conclude, We have our Failings, every Mother’s Child of us; and the Improvidence of my Neighbour must not make me inhumane. The <strong>Ant</strong> did well to <strong>reprove</strong> the <strong>Grasshopper</strong>for her <strong>Slothfulness</strong>; but she did Ill then to refuse her <strong>Charity</strong> in her <strong>Distress</strong>.</p>

		<h2 class="subtitle">("The Fury of Orlando")</h2>
		<p class="abstract">In this episode, a knight named Jocundo discovers his seemingly devoted wife with another man when he unexpectedly returns home to retrieve a momento before setting off with his army. Devestated, Jocundo visits the King Astolfo, who takes notice of Jocundo's saddness and tries to cheer him up. We begin with Jocundo finding a dark room in which to mope.</p>
		<h3>CANTO XXVIII</h3>

		33
		For at the upper end of this old hall,
		There was a place of windows void, and light,
		Save that the lime new moltted from the wall, 
		Let in a little beam that shined bright,
		Here did he see, which some may think a tale,
		A very strange and unexpected sigh,
		He heard it not, but saw it in his view,
		Yet could he scant believ it should be true.

		34
		For at the chink plainly to be seen,
		A chamber hanged with fair and rich array,
		Where none might come but such as trusty been, 
		The Princess here in part does spend the day,
		And here he saw a Dwarf embrace the Queen,
		and strive awhile, and after homely play:
		He skill was such, that ere they went asunder,
		The Dwarf was got aloft, and she lay under. 

		35
		<strong>Jocundo</strong> standeth still as one amazed,
		Supposing sure that he had seen a vision,
		But seeing plain when he awhile had gazed,
		It was an act, and not an apparition:
		Good god (said he) are this Queen's eyes so dazed,
		To love a dwarf more worthy of derision?
		Whose husband is a Prince of worthy fame,
		So brave a man, such love? now fie for shame.

		36
		He now began to hold his wife excused,
		His anger now a little was relented:
		And though that she her body had abused,
		And to her servant had so soon consented;
		Not her for this, but he the sex accued,
		That never can with one man be contented;
		If all (quoth he) with one like stain ar spotted,
		Yet on a monster, mine was not besotted.

		37
		The day ensuring he returned thither,
		And saw the dwarf couragious still and jolly;
		Eke he another day repaired hither,
		And still he found the Queen committing folly:
		He oft returns, he finds them oft togehter,
		They cease not work, on days prophane nor holy:
		Yea which was strange, the goodly Queen complained
		That of the dwarf she found she was dsdained.

		38
		One day when in the corner he had stayed,
		He sees her come all sad and malcontent,
		Because the dwarf his comming still delayed,
		For whom of purpose tiwce before she sent,
		Once more she sends, this answer brings the maid,
		Forsooth unto his play he is so bend,
		That for mistrust at Chess to lease a shilling,
		To come to you the ape's face is not willing.

		39
		<strong>Jocundo</strong>, who before had still been sad, 
		Upon this sight became the better cheer;
		The pains, the ’plaints, the cloudy storms he had, 
		Away were blown, the coast began to clear:
		Most ruddy fair he cheerful grew and glad,
		That angel-like his beauty did appear,
		So as the King and others thought it strange,
		In so short time to find so great a change. 

		40
		Now as the King desire much to know,
		The mean whereby his hurt so soon was healed,
		No less <strong>Jocundo</strong> did desire to show,
		And would not have the thing from him concealed,
		So as his chollerr [fatty neck] might no greater grow,
		Then his had been, when as it were revealed:
		But first he made him swear on his salvation,
		Upon the parties to use no castigation.

		41
		He made him swear, for ought he heard or saw,
		Wherewith his mind might fortune be diseased,
		Yet from his choller so much to withdraw,
		As that in show he may not seem displeased,
		Nor punish it by might nor yet by law,
		Not first nor last, but hold himself appeased,
		S as th’ offenders might not have suspected,
		That their misdeeds were to his grace detected.

		42
		The King so sure, by oth so solemn bound, 
		As one that little thought his Queen so stained,
		<strong>Jocundo</strong> first his own grief did expound,
		Why he so long so dolefull had remained, 
		And in whose arms his own wife he had found, 
		And how the grief thereof so sore him pained,
		Had not that salve uplooked for been applied,
		Of that conceit no doubt he should have died.

		43
		But lying in your highness' house forlorn,
		I saw (quoth he) that ’minished much my mone,
		For though it grieved me to wear a home,
		It pleased me well, I were not alone:
		That said, he brought him where the wall was torn,
		And showed him that, that made his heart to groan,
		For why the dwarf did manage with such skill, 
		Though she curvets, he keeps his stirrup still.

		44
		Much did the King this fool prospect mislike,
		Believe my word, I say, I need not swear,
		Horned wood he was, he was about to strike
		All those he met, and his own flesh to tear;
		His promise to have broken he was like,
		If of his oath he had not had some fear;
		But unrevenged all must now be borne,
		FOr on his <strong>Angus Dei</strong> he had sworn.

		45
		Now to <strong>Jocundo</strong> gently he doth speak,
		Good brother mine, advise me what to do,
		Since I am bound by oath I may not reak
		The fact, twith such revenge as longs thereto;
		Forsooth let's try if others be as weak,
		(<strong>Jocundo</strong> said) and make no more ado:
		This was the council he did give the King,
		Into their order other men to bring. 

		46
		[Jocundo]We both are young, and of such pleasing hue,
		Not to be matched with such another pair;
		What she will be so obstinately true,
		But will be won with youth, and being fair?
		If youth and beauty both do miss their due,
		The want herin our purses shall repair:
		Let us not spare our beauty, youth and treasure,
		Till of a thousand we have had our pleasure.

		47
		To see strange countries placed far apart,
		Of other women eke to make some trial,
		Will ease the pain that formerly [wilholm] pierced our heart,
		And salute out sore, there can be no denial:
		The king that longed to ease his new found smart,
		Consented straight, and to avoid especial’,
		Himself, the Knight, two pages, and no mo’,
		Out of the realm forthwith disguised go.

		48
		Away they passed through Italy and France, 
		And through the Flemish and the English land,
		And those whose beauties highest did advance,
		Those still they found most ready to their hand:
		They give, they take, so lucky is their change, 
		They see their sock at one stay still to stand:
		Some must be wooed forsooth they were so chaste,
		And some there were theat wooed them as fast.

		49
		In countries some a month or two they tarried,
		In some a weeke, in others but a day;
		In all of them they find the women married,
		Like to their wives, too gentle to say nay:
		At least, because they doubt to have miscarried,
		They mean to leave this sport and go their way;
		They found it full of danger and debate,
		To keep their standings in another gate.

		50
		They do agree to take by common voice,
		Someone whose shape and face may please them both,
		In whom without suspect they might rejoyce;
		For wherefore (quoth the King) should I be loth,
		To have yourself a partner in my choice?
		I must have one, and I believe in truth,
		Among all womenkind there is not one,
		That can content herself with one alone.

		51
		But of soome one, we two might take our pleasure, 
		And not enforce ourselves beyond our ease,
		But as they say, take meat and drink, and leisure,
		And by our doings, others not displease;
		Well might that woman think she had a treaure,
		That had vs. two, her appetite to please;
		And though to one man faithful none remain,
		No doubt but faithful they would be to twain. 

		52
		The Roman youth [Jocundo] much praised the Prince’s mind [Astolfo],
		And to perform it, seemed very fane [opposite of “profane”],
		Away they posted as they had assigned, 
		By town and city, over hill and plain, 
		Till at the last a pretty piece they find, 
		The daughter of an Innkeeper in Spain,
		A girl of person tall, and fair of favor,
		Of comely presence, and of good behavior.

		53
		She was new entering in the flower and pride,
		Of thos well-pleasing youthful years and tender,
		Her father many children had beside,
		And poverty had made his portion slender,
		And for them all unable to provide,
		It made him soon consent, away to send her;
		The price agreed, away the strangers carry her,
		Because the father money wants to marry her.

		54
		In concord great she did with them remain, 
		Who took their pleasure one and one by turn, 
		As bellows do, where Vulcans wanted pain, 
		By mutual blast doth make the metal burn:
		Their meaning is, now they had traveled Spain, 
		By Syphax's realm [Numidia] to make their home return;
		And having left Valencia out of sight,
		At fair Xàtiva they did lodge at night.

		55
		The masters go abroad to view the town, 
		And first the Churches for devotions sake;
		And then the monuments of most renown, 
		As trevellers a common custom take:—
		The girl within the chamber sat her down,
		The men are busied, and some the beds do make, 
		Some care to dress their wearied horse, and some
		Make ready meat against their masters' come. 

		56
		In this same house the girl a Greek had spied,
		That in her father's house a boy had been,
		And slept full often sweetly by her side, 
		And much good sport had passed them between;
		Yet fearing lest their love should be descried,
		In open talk they dared not to be seen, 
		But when by hap the pages down were gone,
		Old love renewed, and thus they talk thereon.

		57
		The Greek demands her where she was going, 
		And which of these two great estates her keeps?
		She told them all she needs no further wooing,
		And how a night between them both she sleeps:
		Ah (quote the Greek) thou tellst my undoing,
		My dear <strong>Fiametta</strong>, and with that he weeps;
		With these two Lords wilt thou from Spain be banished?
		Are all my hopes thus into nothing vanished?

		58
		My sweet designments turned are to sower [scattered],
		My service long, finds little recompence;
		I made a stock according to my power,
		By hoarding up my wages, and the pence [type of money]
		That guests did give, that came in lucky hours;
		I meant ere long to have departed hence,
		And to have asked thy firey goodwill to marry thee,
		And that obtained, unto a house to carry thee.

		59
		The wench of her hard fortune did complain, 
		And said that now she doubts he ’sues too late:
		The Greek did sigh and sob, and part did feign,
		And shall I die (quoth he) in this estate?
		Let me enjoy they sweetness once again,
		Before my days draw to their doleful date,
		One small refreshing ere we quite depart,
		Will make me die with more contented heart.

		60
		The girl with pity moved, thus replies,
		Think not (quoth she) but I desire the same;
		But hard it is, among so many companies,
		Without incurring punishment and shame.
		Ah (quoth the Greek) some means thou would devise,
		If thou but felt a quarter of my flame,
		To meet this night in some convenient place,
		And be together but a little space.

		61
		Tush (answered she) you ’sue now out of season,
		For every night I lie betwixt them two,
		And they will quickly fear and find the treason,
		Sit still with one of them I have to do. 
		Well (quoth the Greek) I could refute the reason, 
		If you would put your helping hand thereto,
		You must (said he) some pretty ’scuse devise,
		And find occasion from them both to rise.

		62
		She first bethinks her self, and after bade
		He should return when all were found asleep,
		And learned him, who was thereof right glad,
		To go and come, what order he should keep. 
		Now came the Greek as he his lesson had,
		When all was hushed, as soft as he could creep,
		First to the door, which opened when he pushed,
		Then to the champer, which was softly rushed.

		63
		He takes a long and leisureable stride,
		And longest on the hinder foot he stayed,
		So soft he treads, although his steps were wide,
		As though to tread on eggs he were afriad;
		And as he goes, he gropes on either side, 
		To find the bed, with hands abroad displayed,
		And having found the bottom of the bed,
		He creepeth in, and forward goes his head.

		64
		Between <strong>Fiametta’s</strong> tender thighs he came,
		That lay upright, as ready to receive,
		At last they fell unto their merry game, 
		Embracing sweetly now to take their leave;
		He rode in post, nay can he bait for shame,
		The beast was good, and would not him deceive,
		He think her pace so easy and so sure,
		That all the night to ride he could endure. 

		65
		<strong>Jocundo</strong> and the King do both perceive
		The bed to rock, as oft it comes to pass,
		And both of them one error did deceive,
		For either thought it his companion was:
		Now hat the Greek taken his latter leave,
		And as he came, he back again doth pass,
		And Phebus beams did now to shine begin, 
		<strong>Fiametta</strong> rose and let the pages in.

		66
		Now with Jocundo ’gan the King to jest,
		Brother (quoth he) I doubt we do you wrong,
		It were more time for you to take your rest,
		That have this night a journey rode so long.
		<strong>Jocundo</strong> answers him again in jest,
		Oh for you do mistake, you sing my song;
		Take your ease, and much good do your grade,
		That all this night have rid a hunting pace.

		67
		I, quoth the King? I would in faith I swear,
		Have lent my dog a course among the rest,
		But that I found yourself so busy were,
		And rode so hard, you oculd not spare the beast.
		Well (said the Knight) it seemeth me to bear,
		Although you break your promise and behest,
		Yet privy quips and taunts there needed non,
		You might have bid me let the wench alone.

		68
		One verged so far, the t’other so replied,
		That unto bitter words their tongues were moved,
		Scarce one forbade to say the t’other lied,
		And plain to try whose truth should be reproved,
		They called the girl, the matter to decide,
		Who was afriad, as well to her behooved;
		And she must tell, they standing face to face,
		Whivh of them two deserved this disgrace.

		69
		Tell (quote the King) with grim and angry sight,
		Not fear not him or me, but tell us true,
		Which of us two it was, that all this night so gallantly performed all his due.
		Thus either deeming he did hold the right, 
		They looked both, which should  be found untrue:
		<strong>Fiametta</strong> lowly layed herself on ground,
		Doubting to die becuase her fault was found.

		70
		She humbly pardon cranes for her offence,
		Adn they pitty would her woeful case,
		That she with pity moved to recompence
		His love, that lasted had no little space,
		And who it was, she told them, of of whence,
		Had this ill luck in this unlucky place,
		How she had hoped that though they happened to wake,
		Yet for his partner either would it take.

		71
		The King and his companion greatly mused,
		When they had heard the practice so detected,
		And their conceits not little were confused,
		To hear a hap so strange and unexpected:
		And though no two were ever so abused,
		Yet had they so all wrathful mind rejected,
		That down they lay and fell in such a laughter,
		They could not see nor speak an hour after.

		72
		And when at last their stomachs and their eyes
		Watered and ached, they laughed had so much,
		Such shifts (quoth they) these women will devise,
		Do what we can, their chastity is such:
		If both our cares could not for one suffice,
		That lay betwixt us both, and di us touch,
		If all our hairs were eyes, yet such they said,
		We husbands of our wives should be betrayed.

		73
		We had a thousand women proved before, 
		And one of them denied our request,
		Nor would and if we tried ten thousand more,
		But this one trial passed all the rest:
		Let us not then condemn our wives so sore, 
		That are as chaste and honest as the best,
		Since they be as all other women be,
		Let us turn home, and well with them agree. 

		74
		When on this point they both were thus resolved,
		They gave the Greek, <strong>Fiametta</strong> for his wife
		And tied the knot that cannot be dissolved,
		With protion large, the keep them all their life:
		Themselves went home, and had their sins absolved,
		And take again their wives, and end all strife.
		And thus mine Host the pretty story ended,
		With which he prayed them not to be offended

		(. . . )

		Notes to Canto XXVIII
		In <strong>Jocundo</strong> and <strong>Astolfo</strong> both, may be noted the vanity and beauty in men, and how eak a protection it is, against the blow that never smarteth, as some have termed it. Further, in <strong>Jocundo's</strong> wife, that after all the great protestations of kindness, was taken in bed with his man, we may note that fraud was well as frailty, of some of that sex. In <strong>Fiametta</strong>, that lying between a king and knight, toop up a Tapster into her bed, I cannot tell what to note, but wat which Ovid faith.

		<strong class="latin">Non caret effectu, quod volvuere duo</strong class="latin">.<br/>
		Nought can retarain, consent of twaine.

		In the Queen of Lombardy, that bestowed her love so basely, we may see that no state nor degree is priviledged from shame and slander, except the virtue and grace from above, do keep them from such enormous offences. Further we may see it is a very desperate enterpirse to think by any restraint, to keep an unchaste woman from putting in practice hehr lewd desires. Lastly the defence of women, by the grave wise man, to truly proveth, that though many women are bad, yet many men are worse, and therefore if every one would mend one (as the Prover saith) all shall be mended.
